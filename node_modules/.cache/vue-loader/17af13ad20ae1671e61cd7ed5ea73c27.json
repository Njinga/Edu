        storage of instructional media/technology equipment and materials.\r\n                                        Since instructional media/technology equipment are either expensive\r\n                                        to buy or difficult to obtain, it is necessary that we take care of\r\n                                        them by maintaining them and storing them in the most appropriate and\r\n                                        safest places.
