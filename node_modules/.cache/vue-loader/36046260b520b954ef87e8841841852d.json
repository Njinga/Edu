However, it is\r\n                        not every media that we choose to use that would help the students\r\n                        to learn. We need to remember that our main aim during the lesson is\r\n                        to help students learn. You must be aware by now, that in order for\r\n                        learning to take place, instruction may be necessary. <i>\r\n                            Instruction refers to the\r\n                            arrangement of information and environment to facilitate learning\r\n                        </i>.\r\n                        By environment, this does not just mean where instruction takes place but\r\n                        also the methods, media and equipment that are used or are needed to guide\r\n                        the learner's study.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                        However, information and environment will change\r\n                        depending on the instructional goal. Therefore, as\r\n                        the expected learning outcomes also change, so must\r\n                        the teacher change the way he/she arranges the instructional\r\n                        environment.  For instruction to take place, instructional\r\n                        media are used since they form part of the instructional\r\n                        environment.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                        The instructional/learning process involves the selection,\r\n                        arrangement, and delivery of information in an appropriate\r\n                        environment and the way the learner interacts with that\r\n                        information. Usually the arrangement of information and the\r\n                        environment is normally the responsibility of the instructor\r\n                        and the designers of media.  As a teacher, you need to select,\r\n                        arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate environment\r\n                        so that learners can interact with it and convert it into knowledge.<br />\r\n                        As a teacher, you will have to decide which instructional medium or\r\n                        media to use. To make an informed choice of medium/media from the\r\n                        range of media that we have discussed, you need to know the advantages\r\n                        and limitations of each medium and you need to have a selection criterion\r\n                        that will inform your choice of media.<br />\r\n                        This unit is therefore meant to assist you\r\n                        in making informed decisions on your choice\r\n                        of media during instruction.  To assist you in that regard, we will discuss\r\n                        the criteria for media selection as well as the media selection process.\r\n                        We will also look at some models that are used in making decisions about\r\n                        media choices.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <div class=\"note note-info text-justify\">\r\n                        <blockquote class=\"blockquote bq-info\">\r\n                            <h5 id=\"item-1-1\"><i class=\"fas fa-paper-plane\"> Unit Outcomes</i></h5>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n                                Upon completion of this unit you will be able to:\r\n                                <ul style=\"list-style-type:square;\">\r\n                                    <li>identify the criteria that should be used to select media during instruction</li>\r\n                                    <li>describe the overview of media selection process</li>\r\n                                    <li>present graphically the media selection model.</li>\r\n                                </ul>\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </blockquote>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <div class=\"note note-info text-justify\">\r\n                        <blockquote class=\"blockquote bq-info\">\r\n                            <h5 id=\"item-1-2\"><i class=\"fas fa-check-square\"> Terminology</i></h5>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n                                <kk>Selection of Media:</kk>\tThe process of identifying and selecting the appropriate media to be used in achieving the learning objectives.<br />\r\n                                <br /> <kk>Media Characteristics:</kk>\tQualities of media that we need to exploit when selecting media.<br />\r\n                                <br /><kk>Media Selection Models:</kk>\tSelection models consist of basic elements that need to be taken into consideration when choosing media.<br />\r\n                                <br /><kk>Systems Approach:</kk>\tA way or system of doing things systematically (following a logical and flexible approach).<br />\r\n                                <br /><kk>ASSURE Model:</kk>\tA procedural guide for planning and conducting instruction that incorporates media<br />\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </blockquote>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                        </mdb-row>\r\n                        <br/><br/>\r\n                        <mdb-row class=\"text-justify\">\r\n                            <h2 id=\"item-1\">3.1 Criteria for Selecting Media during instruction </h2>\r\n                            <div class=\"ml-5\">\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                For teachers to adapt their instruction to changing\r\n                                times and environments, they need to have a thorough\r\n                                working knowledge of the many kinds of educational\r\n                                technologies available that might assist in teaching\r\n                                and enhance learning. Educational technologies are the\r\n                                tools that a teacher might need to use in order to\r\n                                create an effective instructional event.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                You need to note that it is not any media that you use that can\r\n                                perform the required instructional role. Research indicates that\r\n                                most media can perform most instructional functions to a certain\r\n                                extent (Aronson, 1977; Briggs, 1968; Briggs & wager, 1981; Clark & Salomon, 1986).\r\n                                According to Gagne, Briggs & Wager (1988), most writers on media selection models\r\n                                agree that there is no one medium that is universally superior to all types of\r\n                                desired outcomes and for all learners.  However, some media are better at\r\n                                doing certain things than others and no single medium can be best for all\r\n                                instructional situations. We therefore need to use a variety of media\r\n                                during instruction. So, the million dollar question to ask then is,\r\n                                <i>'what medium or media shall I use in my lesson?'</i>\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                As you begin your instruction, it is important to select a medium\r\n                                that will enhance your lesson by ensuring optimal use of the media.\r\n                                To select the most appropriate medium/media for your lesson, you will\r\n                                need to ask yourself several questions. The following questions can guide\r\n                                you in selecting the most appropriate media during instruction:\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                <ul>\r\n                                    <li>When do I use media during the lesson?</li>\r\n                                    <li>What will the media do for my students?</li>\r\n                                    <li>How will I select the right media?</li>\r\n                                    <li>How will I prepare for the use of media?</li>\r\n                                </ul>\r\n\r\n                                Below we will try to answer each one of the questions above.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                <kk><i>When do I use media during the lesson?</i></kk><br />\r\n                                You will need to use media if it will assist you to achieve your\r\n                                lesson objective(s). Remember that media can be used at the introduction\r\n                                to a lesson, during the lesson, or when concluding the lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                <kk><i>What will the media do for my students?</i></kk><br />\r\n                                Whenever you select to use media during the lesson, remember\r\n                                that the media has a specific role to play in that lesson.\r\n                                Your role is to help students learn by utilizing the media\r\n                                that you will have selected.

Before selecting any instructional media, always\r\n                                ask your-self this question; <i>\r\n                                    'What type(s) of media can help me to\r\n                                    produce the behaviour required from the learner at the end of the\r\n                                    instructional process?'\r\n                                </i>\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                <kk>Nature of Content</kk><br />\r\n                                The media that you select to use should suit the content to be delivered.\r\n                                If for example you are teaching a lesson in Geography that focuses on World\r\n                                Climates, you will need to use a world map to help the learners locate the\r\n                                different regions of the world that are influenced by the different climates.\r\n                                If you are teaching a lesson in Biology on blood circulation, you might need\r\n                                to use a model so that students can observe the interior of the model to\r\n                                understand how blood flows to and from the heart.\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                <kk>Instructional Strategies being used</kk><br />\r\n                                If in your lesson you would like the students to work together and share experiences,\r\n                                then you cannot use a one directional medium such as audio media. Alternatively,\r\n                                if students have to learn a certain skill and demonstration is necessary,\r\n                                then you will need to use real media or simulations.\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                <kk>Types of learning tasks facing the learners</kk><br />\r\n                                The learning tasks facing the learners influence the choice\r\n                                of media.
