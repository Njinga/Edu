For example, when a classroom\r\n                                        teacher browses the Internet for new teaching materials, that teacher is using some of\r\n                                        the latest educational technology.  What you must realize is that educational technology\r\n                                        is not new at all, and it is by no means limited to the use of equipment let alone\r\n                                        electronic equipment. Modern tools and techniques are simply the latest developments\r\n                                        in a field that some people believe is as old as education itself (Roblyer, 2004).\r\n                                        The definition of the term educational technology varies depending on whether the\r\n                                        term is used by educators or by technologists.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Technology is both a tool and a process. As a process, technology refers to construction\r\n                                        uses and organization of knowledge for the achievement of practical purposes in intellectual\r\n                                        and social contexts while technology as a tool refers to material construction and operation\r\n                                        of physical systems based on knowledge of design.  Technology is commonly thought of in terms\r\n                                        of instruments, machines, and devices.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The term 'education' on the other hand refers to facilitation of learning by\r\n                                        arranging environments and information and it can result from either instruction\r\n                                        or experience.    Many educators use the term educational technology very broadly.\r\n                                        Educational technology for those educators includes any media that can be used\r\n                                        during instruction.  In such cases, educational technology is  simply  defined\r\n                                        as an array of instructional or communication tools that might prove helpful in\r\n                                        advancing student learning (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Please note that by media (also referred to as instructional media) we mean all\r\n                                        the materials and physical means that an instructor might use to implement\r\n                                        instruction and facilitate students' achievement of instructional objectives.\r\n                                        This could include traditional materials such as chalkboards, handouts, charts,\r\n                                        overhead projectors, real objects, as well as the newer materials and methods\r\n                                        such as DVDs, CD-ROMs, the Internet and interactive media.

We have seen how information is disseminated\r\n                                        through a number of media. One such method is <strong>broadcasting</strong>.\r\n                                        Traditionally, radio has been the main form of mass communication technology\r\n                                        that is able to reach many people at once. Radio broadcast can reach communities\r\n                                        at the very end of the development road - people who live in remote areas with\r\n                                        no phones or electricity. Radio reaches people who can't read or write, and even\r\n                                        in very poor communities, radio penetration is vast. Schools can organise radio\r\n                                        listening groups whereby school related programmes can form part of the curriculum\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\" text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Other communication devices include television, the Internet and mobile phones.\r\n                                        These technologies have made it easier for information to reach the general\r\n                                        public, teachers, students, and community members alike. Let us now look at\r\n                                        Information Technology (IT) and its relationship to ICTs.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <h3 id=\"item-3-3\" class=\"h3-responsive\">1.3.3 Information Technology (IT) equipment</h3>\r\n\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <p class=\" text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Information technology is another element of ICTs.\r\n                                        For our purposes in this course, we look at equipment or\r\n                                        hardware. These are the hardware or equipment which\r\n                                        make the software designed to run specific programmes\r\n                                        work. They enable information (sound, text, graphics,\r\n                                        video, etc.) to pass through and reach the recipient\r\n                                        at the receiving end As well. These include computers,\r\n                                        television sets, telephones, radio, fax machines, and\r\n                                        many others. As you can see from the above description,\r\n                                        the same types of technologies keep coming back. Another\r\n                                        important related issue to ICTs is Telecommunication.\r\n                                        This is discussed briefly in the next topic.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <h3 id=\"item-3-4\" class=\"h3-responsive\">1.3.4 Telecommunications</h3>\r\n\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <p class=\" text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Telecommunications are an integral part of ICTs. Through telecommunications,\r\n                                        equipment, hardware, and gadgets are able to send, store, retrieve and\r\n                                        disseminate information to the end user. In this case therefore,\r\n                                        telecommunications may promote or hinder the functioning of IT\r\n                                        equipment and hardware. For example, telephones and mobile-phones\r\n                                        play a major role in connecting people and machines. If they are not\r\n                                        functioning properly, communication will be severely hampered. Are you\r\n                                        familiar with telephone companies that provide Internet services in\r\n                                        Swaziland? This service is enabled by a sound telecommunications infrastructure.\r\n                                        Schools can also be connected to the Internet via this system. ICTs through\r\n                                        telecommunications play a major role in providing communities with ways of\r\n                                        accessing information and knowledge through the following:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li><strong><i>School Libraries</i></strong></li>\r\n                                            School libraries are resource centres where pupils\r\n                                            can access information such as books, pamphlets,\r\n                                            magazines, etc.  Furthermore, a well-equipped school\r\n                                            library can offer other services such as photocopying,\r\n                                            computer facilities, Internet connection as well as\r\n                                            the use and production of audio-visual materials. As a teacher\r\n                                            therefore you should constantly use libraries as well as encourage your\r\n                                            learners to do the same.\r\n\r\n                                            <li><strong><i>Digital Libraries</i></strong></li>\r\n                                            Due to advancement in technology, digital libraries\r\n                                            are now very common in many parts of the world.\r\n                                            While there may not be one in your area, you can\r\n                                            access it through the Internet.  Digital libraries\r\n                                            operate like any ordinary library except that the\r\n                                            materials available are electronic or take a digital\r\n                                            format. Perhaps you have heard of e-books (electronic books).\r\n                                            These are books (just like an ordinary book) except that they\r\n                                            are not hard copies like the ones printed on paper and they cannot\r\n                                            be touched.

For example,\r\n                                        you can search for key words and the system can instantly take\r\n                                        you to those word/s. Moving from section to section and  chapter\r\n                                        to chapter, etc. is easy and fast as well,.  One is also able to\r\n                                        print materials easily. This is possible through what is known as\r\n                                        <i>Hypermedia</i> or <i>Hypertext</i>.

If you can recall, we gave a simple definition of\r\n                                        education technology as <i>\r\n                                            any technology used by educators in support of the teaching\r\n                                            and learning process.\r\n                                        </i>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The best way for students to learn is for them to experience the environment firsthand.\r\n                                        However, it is not always possible to provide learners with firsthand experience as the\r\n                                        environment becomes more complex and some compromise in form of substitute experience\r\n                                        must be developed.  The teacher will need to select and use appropriate media that could\r\n                                        provide substitute experience.  Therefore, instructional media form part of the classroom\r\n                                        communication process and play a vital role in the learning process.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Earlier on, we defined instruction as the arrangement of information and environment to\r\n                                        facilitate learning. That transmission or transfer of information from a source to a\r\n                                        destination is called <strong>communication</strong>.   Since new learning usually depends on taking\r\n                                        in new information, effective instruction cannot take place unless communication takes\r\n                                        place. Therefore, we need to understand the communication process so that we can use\r\n                                        educational technology effectively during instruction.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <h3 id=\"item-5-1\" class=\"h3-responsive\">1.5.1 Communication and learning</h3>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The word 'communication' has its origin from a Latin word, <i>\"communis\"</i> which means,\r\n                                        <i>\"make common\"</i>.

You have ideas and information to\r\n                                        share with your students so that they know these. You need to make a deliberate effort\r\n                                        to influence the students to perceive the ideas and information the same way you do.\r\n                                        This means that you have to follow a process that will help you to share the ideas and\r\n                                        the information with your students. That process is called communication.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        As mentioned previously, communication is the process through which ideas, information,\r\n                                        or skills are passed from a source to a receiver as intended. Communication does not\r\n                                        occur unless the person receiving the message interprets it as intended. This means that\r\n                                        both the source and the receiver must share a common understanding of the message when\r\n                                        communication takes place.   Communication as a process consists of several elements.\r\n                                        These elements include:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>Source</li>\r\n                                            <li>Message (verbal and non -verbal)</li>\r\n                                            <li>Channel</li>\r\n                                            <li>Receiver</li>\r\n                                            <li>Environment</li>\r\n                                            <li>Feedback. </li>\r\n\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        <kk>The source</kk> encodes the message that is conveyed to the receiver.\r\n                                        The source could be you as the teacher or it could be your students.\r\n                                        To encode the message and convey it as intended to the target audience,\r\n                                        the source must have the following characteristics:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>Possess the necessary communication skills such as speaking, reading, writing, and listening.</li>\r\n                                            <li>Have a positive attitude towards self (self-confidence), the receiver of the message and towards the subject matter.</li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                Have good knowledge of the target audience/learners.

For example, you talk\r\n                                        and your audience listens, or you write and they read the content of the\r\n                                        message. Make sure that your message is rooted in their experiences.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        <kk>The message</kk> refers to the content that you are communicating to the audience.\r\n                                        The message could be facts, information, skills, etc.  You should organize the\r\n                                        message in a way that interests the audience and which they can identify with.\r\n                                        Make the message credible and put it at the level of your audience understanding\r\n                                        so that they can easily interpret it.

Media serve as extensions\r\n                                        of our efforts to communicate with the target audience.

Whenever you communicate, you need\r\n                                        to confirm whether the message has been received as you intended.\r\n                                        You should not wait to be told by the receiver whether the message\r\n                                        has been received as intended or not. You should look for feedback\r\n                                        and it does not always have to be verbal or spoken.  Feedback could\r\n                                        be in form of words, expressions, gestures, or other actions (verbal and non-verbal).\r\n                                        Feedback could also be positive or negative.  As a teacher, always be aware of the non-verbal\r\n                                        feedback.

Noise is any disturbance that\r\n                                        interferes with or distorts the transmission of the message.  Noise could have a serious\r\n                                        impact on the success or failure of communication. Noise clouds and masks information transmission\r\n                                        to varying degrees and must be recognized as an obstacle to be overcome (Kemp & Dayton, 1985).\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <h3 id=\"item-5-2\" class=\"h3-responsive\">1.5.2 A simple communication model</h3>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-center\">\r\n                                        <img src=\"../assets/feedback.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        As you might know from your personal experience,\r\n                                        clear and precise communication does not always occur.\r\n                                        There are three types of variables that might interfere\r\n                                        with the communication of ideas namely;\r\n                                        <kk>environmental factors, psychological factors, and personal filters.</kk>\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Environmental factors</kk> are those factors within the environment\r\n                                        that cause a learner to lose focus and disengage from active\r\n                                        participation in the communication process. Such factors could\r\n                                        include; loud noise from outside the classroom, excessive movement, poor lighting,\r\n                                        or poor seating arrangement.

For example, written words or drawings must be large enough\r\n                                        for all students in class to see and read from every corner in the classroom.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Psychological factors</kk> are the unique individual psychological differences\r\n                                        that define and affect the reception of the communication message. For example,\r\n                                        an individual's emotional state at the time the message is transmitted.\r\n                                        Inaccurate reading of feedback could also cause this to happen.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Personal filters</kk> also affect message reception.
