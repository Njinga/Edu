As well as that, educational technology\r\n                                        focuses on the use of resources to facilitate learning. We need to use\r\n                                        instructional media to physically extend our ability to communicate.\r\n                                        We have also looked at ICTs and their relationship to educational\r\n                                        media and/or instructional technology. We have also noted from our\r\n                                        discussion on communication and learning that one of the key\r\n                                        elements of communication is the channel or medium of communication.\r\n                                        The channel/medium carries the message to be shared. We  went on to\r\n                                        say that the medium is indeed the message, since it affects how the\r\n                                        message is received and interpreted by the target audience.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Some of the main channels that we use in human communication are our senses.\r\n                                        We therefore need to use media because they appeal to the different sensory\r\n                                        channels and can make teaching and learning effective. We should therefore\r\n                                        enrich the instructional environment with many and varied experiences including\r\n                                        the use of instructional media.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Perhaps before we discuss the role of\r\n                                        instructional media in teaching and\r\n                                        learning, we need to understand the term 'media'.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <h3 id=\"item-2-1\" class=\"h3-responsive\">2.2.1 What is instructional media?</h3>\r\n                                <div class=\"ml-5\">\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Heinich et al. (1996:8) defines a medium as a means of\r\n                                        communication as it refers to anything that carries\r\n                                        information between a source and a receiver. For example;\r\n                                        diagrams, printed materials, computers, PowerPoint slides,\r\n                                        and instructors. (Please note that the plural for medium is 'media').\r\n                                        We can therefore conclude that, instructional media refers to the\r\n                                        resources both human and non-human that a teacher deliberately\r\n                                        selects and uses to carry information during instruction to\r\n                                        facilitate learning.  These are the resources that serve an\r\n                                        instructional function for education and training.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The terms used to describe the instructional\r\n                                        resources that teachers use in the classroom\r\n                                        have changed over the years to reflect technological\r\n                                        advances in the field of communication. For example,\r\n                                        in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, most of media\r\n                                        available was in form of visuals and it was described\r\n                                        as <i>'visual education</i>, but with the advent of the\r\n                                        radio tape recorders, TV, and a combination of radio and visuals,\r\n                                        the term <i>'audio-visual</i> was accepted. Then in the 1950s,\r\n                                        the term <i>multimedia</i> was coined to describe the early\r\n                                        combination of various still and motion media for increased educational effect.\r\n                                        This reflected a methodology called 'multi-media'\r\n                                        approach, which was based on the principle that a variety\r\n                                        of audiovisual media and experiences could be combined to\r\n                                        reinforce the value of each other.  Later in the 1980s,\r\n                                        the computer technology was introduced into the classrooms\r\n                                        and the technology changed into <i>computer multi-media'. Multimedia</i> refers\r\n                                        to any combination of two or more media formats that are integrated to\r\n                                        form an informational or instructional programme (Heinich, et al.; 1996).\r\n                                        The term was adopted in connection with computers to refer to combinations\r\n                                        of sounds and images stored in different devices and combined through computer\r\n                                        software into an interactive programme.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Today, we can combine a variety of media materials together using\r\n                                        the computer technology to form<i> computer-based instructional media.</i>\r\n                                        Since the early days of simpler media combinations, designers have\r\n                                        understood that individual learners respond differently to various\r\n                                        information sources and instructional methods, and so chances of\r\n                                        reaching an individual are increased when a variety of media is\r\n                                        used as a result of <i>multi-sensory involvement</i>.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        As you continue reading this module, you will\r\n                                        come across the term <kk><i>'Hypermedia'</i></kk>. Hypermedia refers to\r\n                                        a computer software that uses elements of text, graphics, video, and audio\r\n                                        and is connected in such a way that the user can easily move within the information.\r\n                                        Hypermedia is based on cognitive theories of how people structure knowledge and\r\n                                        how they learn. It is designed to resemble the way people organize information\r\n                                        with concepts and relationships.

Material</i> is the term used to refer to\r\n                                        those instructional resources that might be used to convey\r\n                                        information without complete dependence on verbal symbols or\r\n                                        language. For example, concrete objects, construction materials,\r\n                                        pictures and graphics fall in this category. <i>Equipment</i> is what we use\r\n                                        to display the media materials. These include projectors, video\r\n                                        and audio players and computers to mention just a few.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <br />\r\n                                <h3 id=\"item-2-2\" class=\"h3-responsive\">2.2.2 The Role of Media in Teaching and Learning</h3>\r\n                                <div class=\"ml-5\">\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Media serve a variety of roles in education. Their primary role is to help students\r\n                                        learn and one way they do this is by providing an information-rich\r\n                                        environment (Newby; Stepich; Lehman; & Russell, 2006:120).  For example,\r\n                                        media can provide simulated experiences and students do not have to go to\r\n                                        far off places to observe or experience certain reality. A good example is\r\n                                        a flight simulator whereby student pilots learn how to fly an airplane while\r\n                                        still on the ground. Computers also offer simulation capabilities where a motor\r\n                                        mechanic student for example, can observe on a computer, how the engine runs\r\n                                        (pistons running and fuel being burnt). For more on simulation refer to sub-sections 2.3.8.1\r\n                                        (Role of Computers in Instruction) and 5.4.1 (The Computer as a Teacher - Simulation).\r\n                                        In this regard therefore, we can conclude that the use of visuals can add meaning to words,\r\n                                        thus enhancing learning.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The following website offers live experience on simulation in the science\r\n                                        subjects.

Instructional media help to add elements of reality for instance, when you include a picture or a highly involved computer simulation in lecture.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Psychologist Jerome Bruner proposed that instruction should proceed from <kk>direct experience (enactive) to iconic representation</kk> of experience such as the use of pictures and films and finally to <kk>symbolic representation</kk> such as use of words (Bruner, 1966:49).   An icon is an image that resembles a real object.  In other words, students learn best when they observe the reality directly, but when the reality cannot be observed directly, the next best option is to use some representation of the reality through the use of icons such as pictures. The last alternative to use should be a symbolic representation of the reality through the use of words or any other symbols. The reason is that words do not resemble the objects that they represent and therefore cannot be understood unless the individual has some experience with reality about that particular word. Words on their own generally do not carry meanings as meanings are in people depending on their experience with those particular words.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Writing  about concrete-abstract continuum, Edgar Dale in 1969 developed the <kk><i>\"Cone of Experience\", shown in the diagrams below:</i></kk>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Dale's Cone of Experience from (Heinich et al.; 1996: p.16)</kk><br />\r\n                                        <img src=\"../assets/cone1.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\">\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Dale's Cone of Experience Organized according to the degree of Abstraction</kk><br />\r\n                                        <img src=\"../assets/cone2.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\">\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        In the cone of experience, we start with the learner as participant in the actual experience, then move to the learner as an observer of the actual event, then we proceed to the learner as an observer of a mediated event (an event presented through some medium), and finally to the learner observing symbols that represent an event.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The two diagrams above show how Edgar Dale's \"Cone of Experience\" organized learning experiences according to the degree of concreteness each possesses. At the bottom is hands-on experience but as you ascend the cone, concrete experience begins to drop out with the stimuli becoming more abstract. At this stage, the stimuli require more skill on the part of the learners to interpret the images they carry.  That is why a lecture, even when illustrated, is considered as an abstract presentation.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Note that the cone of experience is broad-based at the bottom where direct and purposeful experiences are provided and gets very narrow at the top where verbal symbols are provided. Also note the interdependent nature of learning experiences and instructional materials.   Learning experiences at the bottom of the cone tend to hold students' attention longer and involve active student participation. Media used at the top of the cone are said to be more passive but suitable for transmitting large amounts of information quickly.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <div class=\"note note-primary\">\r\n                                        <blockquote class=\"blockquote bq-primary\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"fas fa-tools\"> Activity 2.1</i><br />\r\n                                            Select any media of your choice and discuss how/why you would use it in the classroom based on Dale's Cone of Experience according to the degree of abstraction.\r\n                                        </blockquote>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Media serve as extensions of our efforts to communicate with our students. A large percentage of things that we learn are a direct result of our visual and audio-visual experiences. Our senses are the gateway to the acquisition of knowledge. According to Sampath (1981), research shows that we learn:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>83% through the sense of sight;</li>\r\n                                            <li>11% through the sense of hearing;</li>\r\n                                            <li>3.5% through the sense of smell;</li>\r\n                                            <li>1.5% through the sense of touch;</li>\r\n                                            <li>1% through the sense of taste.</li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Research also shows that we remember:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                10% of what we hear;\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                50% of what we hear and see;\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                90% of what we hear, see and do.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n\r\n                                        Hence the Chinese saying, <kk><i>\"If I hear, I forget, If I see I remember, If I do, I Know\".</i></kk>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        The above information clearly shows that visual senses are very important in the learning process and that retention of information is closely related to active learner involvement in the learning experience.

New technologies may refer to advanced\r\n                        and upgraded modes of learning that you as a teacher may\r\n                        use to encode messages or content to the learner. These new\r\n                        technologies include Internet connected laptops, computers,\r\n                        audio visuals, smart phones, tablets, projectors, etc. which can\r\n                        be used in teaching and learning. This range of implements can aid\r\n                        in extension of efforts to deliver information and further\r\n                        facilitate proper, better, and easy learning strategies.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                        New technologies may also favour learners who are dispersed to\r\n                        learn wherever they are at affordable costs. Students may not\r\n                        have to travel from their places of residence to institutions or\r\n                        learning centres for face to face sessions with lecturers.\r\n                        They may learn online and submit their assignments there.\r\n                        The new technologies can therefore be a key mediator between\r\n                        the teacher and the learner to convey messages and exchange\r\n                        them. Simulation, enactive and symbolic experiences can be\r\n                        integral in this relation to teaching and learning when\r\n                        technologies are used.<br />\r\n\r\n                        The new technology therefore is very important in learning\r\n                        because these new technologies such as I Pads, electronic\r\n                        readers, smart boards and handheld dictionaries can present\r\n                        information in many different ways. It can present information\r\n                        visually, orally, and in different colours so that every\r\n                        learner can benefit and learn through these new technologies.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n                        On the other hand, Educational Technology as a field of\r\n                        study continues to grow and evolve (Newby et al.; 2006).\r\n                        Today, we see a number of trends that will help educators\r\n                        project where the field is headed for the future.

Non-projected\r\n                                        media include: real objects, models, non-projected visuals (still pictures, charts,\r\n                                        graphs, drawings, posters, cartoons and comics and book illustrations),\r\n                                        visual display surfaces, and printed materials.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Many of the non-projected media that are mentioned and discussed are so common that instructors are inclined to underestimate their instructional value. Most of them are also readily available from textbooks and magazines, as well as from the immediate environment of the school. They are inexpensive, easy to use and some can be obtained at  no cost at all. They can also be produced or developed by teachers. <i>Please note that media do not have to be expensive or exotic to be useful for instruction. What matters is the effectiveness and appropriateness of the media in achieving the instructional goal.</i>    Let us discuss each one of these types of media in some detail.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk> Real Objects</kk><br />\r\n                                        Everywhere in our environment, real things become sources of information or content for teaching and learning. Such objects can also serve as stimulators for learning when they are studied, handled, tasted, and manipulated (Erickson & Curl, 1972:86).  Real objects include; tools, coins, rocks, artifacts or material remains such as costumes, plants, animals, etc.  Real objects are some of the most accessible and interactive materials for educational use.  Real objects fit almost at the bottom of Dale's Cone of Experience and will be most effective especially for learners who are encountering a subject about which they have had little direct experience in their daily lives.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Real objects may be used as they are, or they can be modified to enhance instruction. Examples of modifications include:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                <i>Specimen</i> where actual plants and animals or parts are preserved for later use and close inspection.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                <i>Exhibits</i> where collections of artifacts of either historical or scientific nature are brought together with printed information to illustrate a point.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                <i>Cutaways</i> where devices such as machines have one side cut away to allow close observation of the inside details or inner workings (Heinich et al.; 1996:102).\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Besides using real objects to present information, raise questions, and providing hands-on experiences, real objects also play a variable  role during the evaluation phase of instruction.  They can be displayed in a central place for learners to identify them, describe their function, or  compare and contrast them.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Models</kk><br />\r\n                                        Models refer to three-dimensional representations of a real thing. Things in the real world always have three dimensions. <kk>They have a length, a width and a depth</kk>. Whenever we teach, we need to create as much reality as possible by representing the things, as they would appear in real life.  However, this is not always possible.   For example, you might visit a hydro-electricity power station but still fail to understand how the generator works since you need to look inside the generator to understand how it works. In such a case, a model might be necessary. A model is a scaled representation of the object that it represents. The model might be a true copy of the actual object, might be larger, or even smaller. It might be complete in details or simplified for instructional purpose.  Models can provide learning experiences that real things cannot provide. For example, a model can be dismantled to provide the interior view of the object, which cannot be done with real objects.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n\r\n                                        <img src=\"../assets/cow.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n                                        <kk><i>Model of a cow</i></kk>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        We use models when:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                Inside details must be observed and cannot be better shown using cross-sectional diagrams.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                Too many details which are all relevant appear in a diagram making it difficult to interpret.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                When a third dimension (depth) aids understanding of a concept such as volume in Mathematics.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Models can be manipulated by adding colour, enlarging , or reducing them.

Print media continues to be the most single, most common category of teaching and learning support materials. Even as computer-based multimedia and hypermedia invade the classrooms, through electronic communication such as e-mail systems, database networks, World Wide Web, Hypertext mail, and Portable Document Formats, the role of print is far from being over. Instead, the role of print is being enhanced by the information revolution as the amount of reading and printing that a typical person will engage in increases.   The most common application of text is to present information to students who read the content contained in printed media either for class discussion or for study.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify  meme\">\r\n                                        Printed materials can easily be abused in their usage especially because of the ease with which the materials can be obtained, reproduced and circulated. Therefore, like all other media materials, use of print should be planned. As a teacher, you should determine the learning objectives to be achieved  and then select the print materials that would facilitate your students to achieve those objectives.    Always direct students' reading of printed materials with objectives and questions and supplement the print with other media. Earlier on we identified different types of printed materials. Let us briefly define them.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify  meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Text books</kk>- these are printed materials, in hard copy or electronic, used either for mass instruction, for individual or for group instruction. They serve as a source of information for a particular course, subject or programme. A textbook might be the chief source, a co-basic source, or a supplementary source of information meant to enrich the other sources. E-materials (e-books) are now very common in schools in developed countries. Book readers and Tablets or even mobile phones are used to read e-materials.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify  meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Handouts</kk>- these comprise of the different types of information-providing materials that are given out to students as single loose pages or a number of pages, usually in connection with a taught lesson or programme. They include; sets of notes (complete or in skeleton form), tables, diagrams, maps, or any other illustrations or support materials. In the technological era, electronic handouts are sent by email, accessed at designated websites, and downloaded from school websites and saved on CD's or other portable storage devices such as memory sticks. They can also be stored in mobile devices and used at any time.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify  meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Assignment sheets</kk>- comprise of materials given to students describing the tasks to be carried out. They include; problem description sheets, reading lists, laboratory recording sheets, briefing sheets for projects and seminars, etc. Again, teachers can also use the current technologies to give assignment instructions to learners electronically.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify  meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Resource materials for group exercises</kk> - comprise of the various printed materials (both hard and electronic) that are used in connection with group learning exercises. For example; background reading material, instruction sheets, etc.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify  meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Worksheet</kk>- A worksheet is a device by which the teacher helps the students to work as far as possible to his/her full capacity. Worksheet encourages students to think for themselves about the results of their work and to draw conclusions.

Among the most common still pictures that are used during instruction include; photographs and illustrations from books, calendars, and magazines. Still pictures are mainly two-dimensional but using a series of still pictures taken from different scenes and angles or positions could compensate this shortfall.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Photographs are particularly very useful when you want students to observe certain phenomena and describe their observations as a way of training them in analytical and observation skills.    Still pictures are also useful when you want to illustrate a certain concept; that is, how something looks like. We need to train our students to understand that textbook pictures and illustrations are not decorations and should be read and interpreted as they are also meant to increase understanding of the concepts being presented. As the saying goes, One picture paints a thousand words!' So encourage the students to give attention to them.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Drawings</kk><br />\r\n                                        Drawings are graphic materials that employ graphic arrangement of line and symbols to represent the outline inter - relationships or key features of a person, place, things or concept. Drawings show relationships or help to explain processes such as how something works or is constructed.

Charts are visual representations of abstract relationships such as quantities, chronologies of events, and hierarchies. Most charts serve as visual summaries containing a mix of visual and verbal elements. They could summarize data, explain a process, or describe a set of relationships.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Types of charts</kk><br />\r\n                                        Charts are classified depending on their function and for classroom purposes; we could identify the following types of charts:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>outline and tabular charts;</li>\r\n                                            <li>flow, organization and process charts;</li>\r\n                                            <li>tree and stream charts;</li>\r\n                                            <li>maps</li>\r\n                                            <li>time-line charts.  </li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Outline charts list the key points and sub-points in material while tabular charts present information in columns and are commonly used to present production or sales figures. On the other hand, flow, organization, and process charts are used to show functional relationships such as a manufacturing process or organization of a government department.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Tree and stream charts are used to represent developments and relationships  for example, a family tree or when you want to explain the many end products that are obtained from coal.   As well, time-line charts are used when we want to summarize a sequence of events or to make chronological comparisons, for example, when we want to compare wheat production for different countries over a period of time.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Whenever you decide to use charts, please ensure that:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                you have a clear, well-defined instructional purpose;\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                you represent only one major concept and if you have a lot of information to convey, develop or use a series of charts instead of using a single complex chart to form a flip chart;\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                you have included the minimum of visual and verbal information needed to aid understanding.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Graphs</kk><br />\r\n                                        Graphs are used to provide a visual representation of numerical data. They also illustrate relationships among units of data and trends in the data, such as when you want to show the relationship between time and amounts or yields. Graphs are more visually interesting to observe than when you have raw data.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        There are four major types of graphs: namely; <kk>bar, pictorial, circle and line graphs.</kk>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                <kk>Bar graphs</kk> are mainly used to compare similar items at different times or different items at the same time.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                <kk>Pictorial graphs</kk> are an alternative form of bar graph where a series of simple drawings or pictures are used to represent values and each drawing or picture is then assigned a specific value that relates to the total amount.\r\n                                            </li>\r\n                                            <li>\r\n                                                <kk>Pie or circle graphs</kk> involve dividing a circle into segments and each segment representing a part or a percentage of the whole.

In today's world, you can easily create your own graphs using the computer. All that you need is to input data into the computer and give a command for the computer to create the type of graph that you need. Most spreadsheet programmes like <i>Microsoft Excel</i> have graph and chart options and you can use it to create graphs from numerical data.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Posters</kk><br />\r\n                                        A poster incorporates visual combinations of bold design, colour and a brief written message meant to catch the attention of the viewer instantly in order to convey a message. Posters are meant to catch and hold the viewer,s attention long enough to communicate a message.  Usually posters carry persuasive messages or messages that influence the audience to act in certain way. For example, you might be carrying out a campaign in your school against child or drug abuse. Posters can be used to promote good health practices such as not using drugs. Posters are similar to charts but they are smaller, simpler in detail and bolder in content and style.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        There are two types of posters: namely; <kk>single-glance and stop and study posters. Single glance posters </kk>mainly appeal to emotions and can easily be read and understood without any spoken word.<kk> Stop and study</kk> posters require you to look closely at the poster to interpret it. An effective learning technique is to have your students design posters as part of a class project on a topic you have discussed in class or on a topical issue you are interested in promoting some positive attitudes.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Cartoons and comics</kk><br />\r\n                                        A cartoon is an interpretive picture that makes use of line, symbols and exaggeration to represent ideas, people, events, or situations in pictorial form.  Cartoons are mainly used to influence public opinion.   Cartoons employ the principle of caricature (gross and ludicrous exaggeration or distortion of parts of a whole to emphasize the part i.e. the nose, or the chin). A comic is a form of cartoon in which the characters enact a story in a certain sequence to create a continuous pictorial story.   Both cartoons and comics are humorous and interesting, easy to read and excite the students. Appreciation and interpretation however depends on the experience and ability level of the students.  Therefore, be sure that the cartoons and comics are within the experiential and intellectual range of your students.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <div class=\"note note-primary shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 rounded\">\r\n                                        <blockquote class=\"blockquote bq-info\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"fas fa-tools\"> Activity 2.3</i><br />\r\n\r\n                                            Create a poster or chart explaining a concept in a lesson.

These types of boards are preferred for use around computers since chalk dust can harm computers and disks. The smooth, white plastic surface of a multipurpose board requires a special erasable marker to write.

A bulletin board is a surface of variable size and shape made of material that holds pins, thumbtacks, and other materials without damaging the board.   A bulletin board could be used to display students' work and help to reinforce students' efforts to do a good job.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Cloth board</kk> is constructed of cloth stretched over a backing material such as plywood, masonite, or heavy cardboard. The cloth used could be made of flannel or felt material with a rough surface or from an old blanket for visuals to stick on. The visuals to be displayed on a cloth board should be able to hold onto the cloth by backing the visuals or other items to be attached with a coarse, hook-like texture.  You could also use coarse sandpaper on the back of visuals for attachment to a cloth board.  Cloth boards are useful when describing a certain process or when narrating a story since the visuals could be displayed in a sequence one after the other.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Flip Chart</kk> is a pad of large paper fastened together at the top and mounted to an easel (flip chart stand). Each individual sheet can hold limited verbal/visual message. The message could be written while the presenter is talking or can be prepared in advance.  The most common use of flip charts is for drawing of key illustrations and writing key words during a presentation. It is convenient to use a flip chart since you do not need electric power, it is portable, and only requires marking pen for writing or drawing.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                                        <img src=\"../assets/chart.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n                                        <i>  Flip Chart on a stand</i>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Exhibits</kk> are displays of various objects and visuals designed to form an integrated whole for instructional purposes.

For example, when teaching a topic on rocks, you might have an exhibition of different types of rocks for students to identify.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        <kk>Dioramas</kk> are static displays consisting of a three-dimensional foreground and a flat or two-dimensional background to create a realistic scene. The term 'diorama' is derived from the Greek language and it means 'to see through'. This refers to a medium that enables a teacher to bring little sections of the real world into a classroom for the students to examine.  Dioramas represent three-dimensional scenes often in miniature form to represent natural settings. Dioramas could be used to illustrate different concepts.  For example, in geography they can be constructed to illustrate how certain landforms like craters, rift valleys, etc. are formed.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                                        <img src=\"../assets/box.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n                                        <kk> Example of Diorama showing a waterfall and boxes (3 dimensions)</kk>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        Before you continue reading the module, please stop for a while and carry out the following activity.\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    <div class=\"note note-primary shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 rounded\">\r\n                                        <blockquote class=\"blockquote bq-info\">\r\n                                            <i class=\"fas fa-tools\"> Activity 2.4</i><br />\r\n\r\n                                            <ol>\r\n                                                <li>\r\n                                                    Using your own words, explain why printed materials dominate most instructional situations in Swaziland schools.\r\n                                                </li>\r\n                                                <li>\r\n                                                    List the various non-projected media that we have discussed.

Projection of the image is achieved by passing a strong light through transparent film, magnifying the image through a series of lenses and then casting it onto a reflective surface.   Among the projected media include; overhead projection, multi-image presentations, and computer image projection.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Overhead Projection</kk><br />\r\n                            Overhead projection was once the most widely used audio-visual device in the classroom and in training. Computer projection (commonly PowerPoint) is widely used as well. Due to the fact that the image is large and you can manipulate or add to it while projecting, the overhead projector is versatile and can be used to communicate in every subject in the curriculum. A typical overhead projector is a simple device. Basically, it is a box with a large stage on top. For it to function, light from a powerful lamp inside the box is condensed by a special type of lens called  <kk><i>'Fresnel lens'</i></kk> and passes through a transparency placed on the stage. A transparency refers to the type of film used for overhead projection.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            A transparency is made of photographic film that is capable of being imprinted with an image or text by means of chemical or heat process. The individual sheets of transparent film are called <kk><i>\"acetates\"</i></kk> in reference to the chemical composition of the standard type of film used. Transparencies may be used either individually or might be made into a series of images consisting of a base visual with more transparencies added on top to form <kk><i>overlays</i></kk>. Overlays refer to sheets of transparent film, each containing additional information, that is laid over the base transparency. Overlays could be used to explain complex processes in a step-by-step manner by flipping the overlays one at a time and adding additional details to the base visual.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            During the projection, a lens-and-mirror system that is mounted on a bracket above the box turns the light beam at an angle of 90 degrees and then projects the image back over the shoulder of the presenter. This type of projection where light passes through the transparency is referred to as <kk><i>'trans-missive'</i></kk> type.   In the other type of projector, the light source is above the projector stage and shines down onto the transparency. The light is then reflected by a mirror-like surface beneath the transparency back up and through the lens system. This type is referred to as <kk><i>'reflective'</i></kk> type. The reflective type of projector does not produce brilliant light and does not perform as well as the trans-missive type. However, it is portable, lighter, and more compact than the trans-missive type.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                            <kk> Types of Overhead Projectors (adapted from Heinich et al.; 1996:141)</kk><br />\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <img src=\"../assets/over1.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <img src=\"../assets/over2.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Creating Overhead Transparencies</kk><br />\r\n                            One of the advantages of the overhead projector is that the teacher and students can easily prepare their own transparencies. Some of the methods to use to prepare transparencies include; <kk>direct drawing method and computer printing</kk>. The direct drawing method involves drawing directly onto a transparency sheet (write-on transparency) using a transparency-marking pen (overhead projector pen). Overheads created by computers have transformed the task of creating overhead transparencies with the use of any word processing software to prepare simple verbal overheads which can then be printed on plain paper to make a master copy for photocopying.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Advantages of the Overhead Projector</kk><br />\r\n                            The overhead projector has the following advantages:\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Brightness</i>- the lamp and the efficient optical system generates so much light on the screen that the overhead can be used with normal room lighting.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Eye contact</i>- the projector is operated from the front of the room with the presenter facing the audience allowing direct eye contact to be maintained.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Ease of use</i>- overhead projectors are easy to operate and portable.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Manipulability</i>- projected materials can be manipulated by the presenter.

Therefore, as teachers we can develop students' listening skills by using the audio media. Audio media refers to the use of human voice and other sounds for instructional purposes (Gathu, 2000:43).  Audio recordings can be prepared for group or individual listening and they can be used in a variety of ways. For example, a speech could be documented, a role-play or drama could be recorded, animal sounds could be recorded, and a meeting could also be verbally recorded.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Audio media could be used in different formats which include:\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>Compact discs (CD)</li>\r\n                                <li>MP3/MP4 players</li>\r\n                                <li>Mobile phones</li>\r\n                                <li>Other digital electronic gadgets</li>\r\n                                <li>Podcasts </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Examples of audio media usage in the classroom</kk>\r\n                            <ol>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    Recording different sounds and playing them back to the students\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    Learners recording their voices while reading paragraphs then listening for correctness of pronunciations, etc.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    Students with hearing problems or with learning difficulties can revisit classroom presentations in any of the subjects taught in order to reinforce what was taught in class.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                            </ol>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Compact Discs</kk><br />\r\n                            A CD uses a tiny laser beam to retrieve the information from the disk.

The instructor or students can selectively retrieve information from a CD since the digital storage format provides for random access of the data stored which means that you can directly go to and play any segment on a CD.  To use the CD, you will need a CD player though most computers have a CD deck as part of the computer accessories.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Please note that once digitized, audio media can be delivered through the Internet.

The primary meaning of video is the playing of moving images on a television type screen. Video images are recorded electronically on magnetic tape along with sound for playback.  Any media format that uses a television screen or monitor to present a picture can be referred to as video (e.g. DVD).  Originally, the concept of video was synonymous with broadcast television, but the concept has expanded dramatically in recent years. New technologies connected to television sets have been added such as home computers, video games and specialized cable TV services.   There are different formats of video. Among them are: video files, videodiscs, and compact discs.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk> Videodisc</kk><br />\r\n                            A newer type of video medium called <kk><i>'digital video disc'</i></kk> (DVD) has rapidly replaced the video and laser discs.  DVD is a compact disc format for displaying motion video, which offers truly digital, optical recording, storage, and playback of full-motion video. A DVD has the same physical size as an audio CD or CD-ROM but it can hold four times as much data as a CD or CD-ROM.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Digital Video Camera</kk><br />\r\n                            The most common option for creating digital video recording is using a digital video camera. A digital video camera captures and stores the target image in a digital format that can be downloaded to a personal computer or laptop. Some newer cameras can create a DVD that can be played instantly on any playback device. The resultant video files can then be manipulated, edited, and enhanced using digital video editing software. A digital video camera allows you to record digital images on storage devices and later transfer to a computer or for playback on a television. The user can edit the video on the camera before processing (using the camera) for final play on other devices.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Current capabilities of video</kk><br />\r\n                            Currently video is used in many ways.

Please refer to the relevant section in Unit 1\r\n                            and also to your <kk>EDC 100 Teaching Principles and Practice</kk> course module to remind yourself on the cognitive learning theory.\r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Hypermedia is designed to resemble the way people organize information with concepts and their relationships. These relationships or <kk><i>links</i></kk> are associations between ideas. For example, when you think about a bicycle, you create a link between ideas about transportation and recreation. With hypermedia, one can compose and display information that might include text, audio, and visual information. Using the example of the bicycle, the learner can connect the word 'bicycle' with a photograph of a girl riding a bicycle in the field.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Computer hypermedia systems can be used for different instructional purposes. Among them are:\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Browsing- </i>where users navigate through information by choosing routes that are of interest.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Linking-</i>where users create their own special connections within the information.\r\n                                </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    <i>Authoring- </i>The process of creating multimedia or hypermedia is called <kk><i>authoring</i></kk>. This is where users create their own unique collections of information by adding or linking text, graphics, and audio as they wish\r\n                                </li>\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            The most common application of hypermedia authoring in a classroom is when students develop hypermedia projects that allow students either as individuals or as groups to create reports that summarize major efforts as in the case of a science experiment. Instead of merely compiling a written report, students could include written work with pictures, sound clips, video and links to describe what they did.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <div class=\"note note-primary shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 rounded\">\r\n                            Let us pause for a little.

It is also commonly associated with Web 2.0 technology that focuses on integration, collaboration, and interaction. While you may collaborate or interact through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), Web 2.0 also allows collaboration through teaching and learning. Some of these media may be termed \"Participative Delivery Systems.\" In this case participants are the major authors as they create the content and supporting materials. Some of these technologies include Wikis and Blogs.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <i>Collaborative/Participative technologies</i> offer a range of new ways that support learning by enabling learners to share and exchange both ideas and their own digital products. The technologies provide opportunities for building tools not only for authoring interactive multimedia content, but also for enhancing readers' experience beyond multi-media presentation, for example, through sharing comments, in-book search, browsing, skimming, visualisation, summarisation, and non-linear reading. Below are some participative tools we can use.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Google Docs (docs.google.com)</kk><br />\r\n                            Google Docs is a lightweight Web-based suite of office applications that includes a <i>word processor, a presentation tool</i>, and a spread sheet tool. With this tool, you can create, edit and share documents online. The three Google Docs tools support <i>multiple authors</i> editing the same document, presentation, or spread sheet at the same time, tracking revisions and showing, near real time, what each author is doing. Because the documents are stored online, they are available on any computer connected to the Internet. Import and export options allow one to upload Word docs, Excel, PowerPoint and PDFs and output back in the same format. One can also quickly publish what has been created online with a click of a button.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Students can use Google Docs to coordinate group work, including group papers. Instructors can easily monitor individual contributions using Docs's revision tracking tools. Likewise, facilitators can simplify collaborative paper writing with colleagues by sharing the same document with multiple authors without the worry of coordinating various individual versions. Google Docs is free for anyone to use.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            <kk>Skype (www.skype.com)</kk><br />\r\n                            Skype is a powerful video and voice application.

While most calls are free (depending on the service options one selects) when they are made to other computers, calls can also be made to mobile devices or landlines for a fee.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Skype can be used as a means to connect users from around the world. This free and easy to use application can connect colleagues, students and researchers all within a web browser. So whether it is for office hours or to help students complete group work online, Skype is a great tool for any educator. The best thing about Skype is the ability to make free phone calls (with or without video).\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Some limitations of Skype however are that:\r\n                            <ol>\r\n                                <li>It does not support emergency calls (i.e., 911),  </li>\r\n                                <li>Calls may be dropped from time to time (depending on your internet speed), and </li>\r\n                                <li>Some organizations might block the use of Skype on their network. </li>\r\n                                <li>The cost of Skype varies depending on use.

Videos uploaded to YouTube can be accessed and viewed by a select group of users or open for anyone to view. Users can also view, comment, rate, embed, and link to their videos as well as the millions of other videos posted to the site. Signing up for YouTube is free and easy. Further, even if you do not plan to upload your own videos, signing up for an account enables you to bookmark your favourites and to create playlists.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            YouTube has become one of the largest repositories for video on the Internet, making it a great resource for educators. Staff and students can often find dozens, if not hundreds, of videos about the topics of their choice. YouTube has partnered with several universities and launched YouTube EDU focusing on university related videos and lectures. YouTube is also a great tool for creating personalized content allowing faculty to record lectures, introductions, and commentary.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            The benefits of YouTube is that it is free, easy to use, supports high definition (HD) content and users can set their videos to public or private. The only major drawback of YouTube is that it limits users to uploading videos that are 1 GB or less than 10 minutes in length. One other minor drawback is that a video can be removed from YouTube at any time throughout the semester. YouTube is free and does not cost anything to use.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <h4 id=\"item-3-6-1\" class=\"h4-responsive\">2.3.6.1 Other capabilities of Social Media</h4>\r\n                    <div class=\"ml-5\">\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Social media platforms also allow users to have conversations, share information and create web content. There are many forms of social media, including blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, social networking sites, photo-sharing sites, instant messaging, video-sharing sites, podcasts, widgets, virtual worlds, and more.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            There are many ways in which information is conveyed from one person to the other. In the teaching/leaning process communication through social media is vital and its roles are numerous. Firstly it serves the purpose of the ease of learning. It provides learners with a situation where knowledge is abundantly available. Visuals help in adding meaning to words. As it is widely known in teaching, leaners understand better when they see and touch something. So when you explain abstract ideas then bring in a projector to show them what you mean, it helps to add the element of reality as they are seeing the object in front of them.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            Social media is used as extensions of our efforts to communicate with students. Research shows that a major percentage (83%) of what people learn is derived through the sense of sight. Social media are also used to support instructional activities like feedback to students' work, visualisation of a lesson, transferring of abstract concepts to concrete objects, and presentation of new content. Media also helps learners to overcome physical limitations, improves the quality of learning and assists to provoke learners to change attitude of mind.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"text-center meme\">\r\n                            <img src=\"../assets/social.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Responsive image\"><br />\r\n                            <kk><i>Graphic showing different types of Social Media</i></kk>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <div class=\"note note-primary shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 rounded\">\r\n\r\n                            <blockquote class=\"blockquote bq-info\">\r\n                                <i class=\"fas fa-tools\"> Activity 2.8</i><br />\r\n                                Conduct an Internet search and report the uses of social media in the classroom\r\n\r\n\r\n                            </blockquote>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    <h5 id=\"item-3-6-1-1\" class=\"h5-responsive\">2.3.6.1.1 Wiki</h5>\r\n                    <div class=\"ml-5\">\r\n                        <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                            A wiki is a type of free online writing space that allows users to add, modify and update its pages.
