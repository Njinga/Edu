                            teachers that we could use during instruction.  However, it is\r\n                                    not every media that we choose to use that would help the students\r\n                                    to learn. We need to remember that our main aim during the lesson is\r\n                                    to help students learn. You must be aware by now, that in order for\r\n                                    learning to take place, instruction may be necessary. <i>\r\n                                        Instruction refers to the\r\n                                        arrangement of information and environment to facilitate learning\r\n                                    </i>.\r\n                                    By environment, this does not just mean where instruction takes place but\r\n                                    also the methods, media and equipment that are used or are needed to guide\r\n                                    the learner's study.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                    However, information and environment will change\r\n                                    depending on the instructional goal. Therefore, as\r\n                                    the expected learning outcomes also change, so must\r\n                                    the teacher change the way he/she arranges the instructional\r\n                                    environment.  For instruction to take place, instructional\r\n                                    media are used since they form part of the instructional\r\n                                    environment.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\"text-justify\">\r\n\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                    The instructional/learning process involves the selection,\r\n                                    arrangement, and delivery of information in an appropriate\r\n                                    environment and the way the learner interacts with that\r\n                                    information. Usually the arrangement of information and the\r\n                                    environment is normally the responsibility of the instructor\r\n                                    and the designers of media.  As a teacher, you need to select,\r\n                                    arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate environment\r\n                                    so that learners can interact with it and convert it into knowledge.<br />\r\n                                    As a teacher, you will have to decide which instructional medium or\r\n                                    media to use. To make an informed choice of medium/media from the\r\n                                    range of media that we have discussed, you need to know the advantages\r\n                                    and limitations of each medium and you need to have a selection criterion\r\n                                    that will inform your choice of media.<br />\r\n                                    This unit is therefore meant to assist you\r\n                                    in making informed decisions on your choice\r\n                                    of media during instruction.

Research indicates that\r\n                                    most media can perform most instructional functions to a certain\r\n                                    extent (Aronson, 1977; Briggs, 1968; Briggs & wager, 1981; Clark & Salomon, 1986).\r\n                                    According to Gagne, Briggs & Wager (1988), most writers on media selection models\r\n                                    agree that there is no one medium that is universally superior to all types of\r\n                                    desired outcomes and for all learners.  However, some media are better at\r\n                                    doing certain things than others and no single medium can be best for all\r\n                                    instructional situations. We therefore need to use a variety of media\r\n                                    during instruction. So, the million dollar question to ask then is,\r\n                                    <i>'what medium or media shall I use in my lesson?'</i>\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                    As you begin your instruction, it is important to select a medium\r\n                                    that will enhance your lesson by ensuring optimal use of the media.\r\n                                    To select the most appropriate medium/media for your lesson, you will\r\n                                    need to ask yourself several questions.

A systems\r\n                                    approach is a procedural way of thinking about problems in education.\r\n                                    A systems approach can be defined as; <em>\r\n                                        'an overall approach that\r\n                                        involves tackling problems in a disciplined manner keeping priorities\r\n                                        in mind. The sub-system making up the overall system can be designed,\r\n                                        fitted, checked, and operated so as to achieve the overall objective\r\n                                        efficiently (Rowntree, 1974).\r\n                                    </em>\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\" text-justify meme\">\r\n                                    A system can also be described as the sum total of interrelated parts\r\n                                    working together to form a complete whole. For example, a car or the\r\n                                    human body is a system. Even an institution like the University of Swaziland\r\n                                    (UNISWA) is a system.  A system contains certain elements; i.e. inputs,\r\n                                    outputs, environment, sub-systems, etc.  Any system receives inputs\r\n                                    from the environment and gives out outputs after they have been processed.\r\n                                    However, within a system, there are sub-systems which function independently\r\n                                    of each other. When the sub-systems combine together, they form a complete\r\n                                    whole.

For example, students with\r\n                                    substandard reading skills may be reached more effectively\r\n                                    with non-print media than with print. When teaching students\r\n                                    in Swaziland, use of materials that represent familiar cultural\r\n                                    identity will be more effective than when you use materials that\r\n                                    are completely foreign to them. When you are teaching students that\r\n                                    are entering a new conceptual area for the first time, direct and\r\n                                    concrete experiences such as field trips will be more effective.\r\n                                    Heterogeneous groups which include learners varying widely in their\r\n                                    conceptual sophistication or in amount of first-hand experience on a\r\n                                    certain topic will benefit more from an audio-visual experience\r\n                                    such as a videotape.\r\n\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\" text-justify meme\">\r\n                                    <kk>Specific entry competencies</kk><br />\r\n                                    Students' prior knowledge of a particular subject influences\r\n                                    how and what they learn. This means that before you plan a lesson,\r\n                                    you need to verify the entry competencies of the learners, either\r\n                                    through informal means such as in-class questioning, or formally\r\n                                    through tests.

They are best with workbooks, demonstration, and\r\n                                    structured laboratory exercises. Concrete random learners lean towards\r\n                                    a trial-and-error approach and reaching conclusions from exploratory experiences.\r\n                                    They prefer methods such as games, simulations, independent study projects and\r\n                                    discovery learning.

Motivation is a common influence on human activities. Motivation makes\r\n                                    direct contribution to learning by focusing students on certain desired learning\r\n                                    goals and increasing the effort they expend in reaching those goals (Newby et al., 2006).\r\n                                    Various emotional factors do influence what we pay attention to, how long we pay attention,\r\n                                    how much effort we invest in learning, and how feelings may interfere with learning.\r\n                                    Anxieties, locus of control, achievement motivation and competitiveness, are critical\r\n                                    variables to the learning process.<br />\r\n                                    Knowing something about your students' motivation will help with instructional\r\n                                    planning as it will help you to add to the extrinsic or intrinsic appeal of\r\n                                    instruction especially with regard to choice of instructional media.\r\n                                    For example, you might use curiosity by presenting students with a variety of\r\n                                    situations that are unique, surprising, or inconsistent with their existing ideas.\r\n\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p class=\" text-justify meme\">\r\n                                    <kk>Physiological factors</kk><br />\r\n                                    These are factors related to gender differences,\r\n                                    health, and environmental conditions.

In this unit we have\r\n                                        noted that media to be used for instructional purposes should\r\n                                        not be selected just because it is available or because the teacher\r\n                                        prefers to use such media.  Instructional media should be selected\r\n                                        based on a given criteria.

The sub-systems making up\r\n                                        the overall system are designed, fitted, checked and\r\n                                        operated so as to achieve the overall objective efficiently.\r\n                                        We noted that the systems approach is a problem-solving method\r\n                                        that helps to:\r\n                                        <ul>\r\n                                            <li>Define the problem as clearly as possible;</li>\r\n                                            <li>Analyze the problem and identify alternative solutions.</li>\r\n                                            <li>Select the alternatives and develop the most viable solution mix.</li>\r\n                                            <li>Implement and test the solution.</li>\r\n                                            <li>Evaluate the effectiveness and worth of the solution.  </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </p>\r\n                                    <p class=\"text-justify meme\">\r\n                                        We went on to discuss the application of the systems approach to\r\n                                        media selection and use.  Here we noted that we have to be systematic\r\n                                        as we select media and materials. We have to be guided by some instructional\r\n                                        goal/objectives and the focus should be the learner.  We concluded the unit\r\n                                        by discussing the ASSURE model which is a procedural guide for planning\r\n                                        instruction that incorporates the use of media. We noted that use of media\r\n                                        has to be carried out in a systematic manner and the six procedural steps\r\n                                        have to be followed.
