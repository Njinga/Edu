                                        In this unit, we are going to discuss maintenance, care, and
                                        storage of instructional media/technology equipment and materials.
                                        Since instructional media/technology equipment are either expensive
                                        to buy or difficult to obtain, it is necessary that we take care of
                                        them by maintaining them and storing them in the most appropriate and
                                        safest places.  We also need to know how to trouble shoot when using the
                                        equipment and materials since several problems may arise whenever we
                                        use media equipment and materials. Note that it is not possible to discuss
                                        the maintenance, care and storage of all the equipment and materials that
                                        you are likely to use. In this case, we will select and discuss how to maintain,
                                        care and store some of the equipment/technologies and materials.

                                        Most users of technology are not and do not expect to become electronic wizards or
                                        specialists but they want to be able to use the hard-ware safely and effectively.
                                        The most fundamental elements of effective technology use are simply getting the
                                        equipment properly set up, keeping it running, and being ready to cope with snags,
                                        which always seem to occur at the most inopportune times (Heinich et al., 1996:364).
                                        A major concern to consider whenever we use technology is safety. Accidents involving
                                        equipment can be serious and even fatal. You or your students could sustain injuries if
                                        you mishandle equipment. As an educator, you are responsible and legally liable if students
                                        are exposed to hazardous conditions. As a teacher, you serve as role model for safe practices
                                        when using technology and you need to know and practice good safety habits.

                                        The overhead projector (For more information see section 2.3.5 - Projected Media)
                                        is an equipment with a few components that require special maintenance procedures.
                                        However, you need to take a few basic precautions to ensure that the projector keeps
                                        putting on a bright performance. Some of the precautions include:
                                    </p>

                                                Keeping it as clean as possible. The horizontal stage which is made up of
                                                glass tends to gather dust and finger prints stick on. It should be cleaned
                                                regularly with lens tissue and proper lens cleaning solution. If possible,
                                                keep the glass surface covered in flannel cloth. This will help avoid
                                                scratching and dust accumulation.

                                                for projection should be protected in order to lengthen its life span since it is
                                                very expensive. The best way to lengthen the life of the lamp is to ensure that the
                                                projector is not left on for too long since overheating damages the lamp. Never
                                                touch the lamp when it is hot nor should you touch a new lamp with bare fingers
                                                since this shortens its life span.

                                        To get the best out of your overhead or computer projector, you need to know how to
                                        operate it the right way. Follow the following steps to operate an overhead projector:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Connect the power cord to the power outlet</li>
                                            <li>Turn the projector on</li>
                                            <li>Position the transparency on stage</li>
                                            <li>Adjust the projector to eliminate key stoning effect</li>
                                            <li>Focus the image.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                                        <i><kk>Key stone effect</kk></i> refers to a distortion of the image.
                                        The effect takes its name from the typical shape of a key-stoned image
                                        which is wide at the top and narrower at the bottom like a keystone.
                                        The key stone is caused by the position in which the projector is placed.
                                        If the projector is too high, too low or off either sides, a distortion of
                                        the image will occur. To remedy this situation, you can either  move the projector
                                        or the screen to bring the two into perpendicular relationship.
                                    </p>

                                        Once you have aligned the projector and screen, consider the distance between them.
                                        If the distance is too long, the image will spill over the edges of a screen and if the
                                        distance is too short, the image will not fill the screen properly.

                                                When no power comes on after switching on the equipment.
                                                You need to be sure that the projector is plugged into an electric
                                                outlet and that there is electric power in that power point. At times

                                        and needs proper storage, maintenance and care. This is the computer projector or commonly
                                        known as LCD (Liquid Digital Display). Normally they are small in size and quite portable.

                                                The lab rules and regulations should be posted prominently
                                                and should apply to everyone who uses the lab  Such rules should

                                                <i>Maintenance needs and options. </i> Each teacher who uses the equipment needs training
                                                in simple troubleshooting procedures such as making sure a printer is plugged in and on-line or
                                                what to do when the computer display a message "a disk is unreadable".  Schools could minimize
                                                repair problems if users follow good usage rules and conduct preventive maintenance procedures.
                                                For the computer and other equipment, it is necessary to have a maintenance policy. For example,
                                                establish a maintenance contract with an external supplier and set aside a maintenance budget.<br /><br />

                                                <i>Securing the resources</i> Security is a separate but equally important maintenance issue
                                                since loss of equipment from vandalism and theft is a common problem in schools.
                                                Many of the computer accessories are very portable and can easily be stolen. A school
                                                needs to devise a security system that would work for them to protect the equipment from
                                                being stolen. <br /><br />

                                                <i>Viruses: causes, prevention and cures. </i> Computer viruses are programmes written
                                                specifically to cause damage or corrupt other programmes or information (Hansen & Koltes, 1992).
                                                Like real viruses, these programmes can be passed to other programmes with which they come in contact.
                                                For instance, they infect other computers by connecting one computer to another via telecommunications or by
                                                inserting a disk containing the virus into a computer. Some viruses are carried into a computer system on
                                                <kk><i>Trojan horses</i></kk> or attractive programmes designed for another purpose but which carry
                                                instructions that get around protection codes (Lee, 1992). Some viruses are <i>worms</i> or programmes
                                                designed specifically to run simultaneously with other programmes. Many different strains of viruses
                                                plague computer systems and more are being generated.  The impact of the virus takes many forms. Some
                                                viruses eat through data stored in a computer; others replicate copies of themselves in computer memory and
                                                destroy files. Viruses have the general effect of tying up computer resources, frustrating users and wasting
                                                valuable time.  To deal with the problem of viruses, Dormady (1991) recommends a four-point programme to minimize
                                                the impact of viruses: establish good practices (scan systems and disks regularly, back up important data or files,
                                                enforce safety policies (no unauthorized programmes), use virus management programmes.

                                        Therefore, an area should be created and partitioned
                                        where the equipment and materials can be stored. For convenience,
                                        shelves should be erected for storing the projectors and other equipment.
                                        Make sure that all equipment have an outer cover to protect them from dust.
                                        For good maintenance, essential spare parts such as projection lamps, belts,

                                        use a layer of paper in between the transparencies to
                                        prevent them from sticking against each other.

                                        in reasonably wide drawers and lay them flat to prevent them

                                        should be put in files or in large envelopes before storing them in drawers or cabinets.

                                            In this unit we have discussed how to care, maintain and store media equipment and
                                            materials. We have given some examples to illustrate how to care and maintain equipment
                                            the equipment. We have noted that one major concern whenever we use equipment and materials
                                            is safety. We have mentioned that since electronic equipment is expensive; we should take
                                            good care of it through proper maintenance and handling. I hope you will apply some of
                                            the techniques that we have discussed to care and maintain your equipment in order to prolong
                                            their life span and for them to serve you better.
