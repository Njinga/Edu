                                            Some of the questions that you
                                            need to ask yourself include the following:

                                                What is Educational Technology? What other

                                                Is Educational Technology relevant to teaching and learning?
                                            </i>
                                            The unit also introduces you to Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
                                            which is closely related to educational/instructional technologies as they too
                                            (ICTs) are used as equipment and tools when teaching learners in a classroom.

                                        The concept 'Educational Technology' is very wide and as a result difficult to define.
                                        The term itself has been evolving over a very long time.   For example, when a classroom
                                        teacher browses the Internet for new teaching materials, that teacher is using some of
                                        the latest educational technology.  What you must realize is that educational technology
                                        is not new at all, and it is by no means limited to the use of equipment let alone
                                        electronic equipment. Modern tools and techniques are simply the latest developments
                                        in a field that some people believe is as old as education itself (Roblyer, 2004).
                                        The definition of the term educational technology varies depending on whether the
                                        term is used by educators or by technologists.

                                        Technology is both a tool and a process. As a process, technology refers to construction
                                        uses and organization of knowledge for the achievement of practical purposes in intellectual
                                        and social contexts while technology as a tool refers to material construction and operation
                                        of physical systems based on knowledge of design.  Technology is commonly thought of in terms
                                        of instruments, machines, and devices.

                                        The term 'education' on the other hand refers to facilitation of learning by
                                        arranging environments and information and it can result from either instruction
                                        or experience.    Many educators use the term educational technology very broadly.
                                        Educational technology for those educators includes any media that can be used
                                        during instruction.  In such cases, educational technology is  simply  defined
                                        as an array of instructional or communication tools that might prove helpful in
                                        advancing student learning (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).

                                        instruction and facilitate students' achievement of instructional objectives.
                                        This could include traditional materials such as chalkboards, handouts, charts,

                                        where for instance, people from one country can learn about happenings
                                        in many other countries or even across continents as soon as the news
                                        break. People can communicate with each other globally instantly and
                                        access information or relevant data when needed at the mere touch of
                                        a button. ICTs and traditional mass media such as television,
                                        newspapers and radio, are therefore some of the components of
                                        the information-transfer system in international communication.
                                        Do you see the resemblance to educational technologies?

                                        Television, newspapers and
                                        radio are considered components of information transfer because of
                                        the role they play in disseminating information to people in a 'mass' format.
                                        The degree of their usage however varies based on the location and/or situation
                                        one is in. In most African countries for example, the above communication devices,
                                        including radio and television are the most common means of sharing ideas and disseminating
                                        information. The above are also widely used in schools.

                                        While the term 'ICTs' can be interpreted as including a wide range of media, 'new ICTs' is used
                                        to denote the use of computers and communication systems between computers.
                                        These new ICTs are becoming more accessible, and users can obtain information

                                        ICTs are a media of communication. We have seen how information is disseminated
                                        through a number of media. One such method is <strong>broadcasting</strong>.
                                        Traditionally, radio has been the main form of mass communication technology
                                        that is able to reach many people at once. Radio broadcast can reach communities
                                        at the very end of the development road - people who live in remote areas with
                                        no phones or electricity. Radio reaches people who can't read or write, and even
                                        in very poor communities, radio penetration is vast. Schools can organise radio
                                        listening groups whereby school related programmes can form part of the curriculum

                                        Other communication devices include television, the Internet and mobile phones.
                                        These technologies have made it easier for information to reach the general
                                        public, teachers, students, and community members alike. Let us now look at
                                        Information Technology (IT) and its relationship to ICTs.

                                        Information technology is another element of ICTs.
                                        For our purposes in this course, we look at equipment or
                                        hardware. These are the hardware or equipment which
                                        make the software designed to run specific programmes
                                        work. They enable information (sound, text, graphics,
                                        video, etc.) to pass through and reach the recipient
                                        at the receiving end As well. These include computers,
                                        television sets, telephones, radio, fax machines, and
                                        many others. As you can see from the above description,
                                        the same types of technologies keep coming back. Another
                                        important related issue to ICTs is Telecommunication.
                                        This is discussed briefly in the next topic.

                                        Telecommunications are an integral part of ICTs. Through telecommunications,
                                        equipment, hardware, and gadgets are able to send, store, retrieve and
                                        disseminate information to the end user. In this case therefore,
                                        telecommunications may promote or hinder the functioning of IT
                                        equipment and hardware. For example, telephones and mobile-phones
                                        play a major role in connecting people and machines. If they are not
                                        functioning properly, communication will be severely hampered. Are you
                                        familiar with telephone companies that provide Internet services in
                                        Swaziland? This service is enabled by a sound telecommunications infrastructure.
                                        Schools can also be connected to the Internet via this system. ICTs through
                                        telecommunications play a major role in providing communities with ways of
                                        accessing information and knowledge through the following:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong><i>School Libraries</i></strong></li>
                                            School libraries are resource centres where pupils
                                            can access information such as books, pamphlets,
                                            magazines, etc.  Furthermore, a well-equipped school
                                            library can offer other services such as photocopying,
                                            computer facilities, Internet connection as well as
                                            the use and production of audio-visual materials. As a teacher
                                            therefore you should constantly use libraries as well as encourage your
                                            learners to do the same.

                                            <li><strong><i>Digital Libraries</i></strong></li>
                                            Due to advancement in technology, digital libraries
                                            are now very common in many parts of the world.
                                            While there may not be one in your area, you can
                                            access it through the Internet.  Digital libraries
                                            operate like any ordinary library except that the
                                            materials available are electronic or take a digital
                                            format. Perhaps you have heard of e-books (electronic books).
                                            These are books (just like an ordinary book) except that they
                                            are not hard copies like the ones printed on paper and they cannot
                                            be touched. They are digital or electronic.
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                                        Digital and/or electronic materials are easily accessed and  easy to go
                                        through (navigate) unlike  ordinary books.  For example,
                                        you can search for key words and the system can instantly take
                                        you to those word/s. Moving from section to section and  chapter
                                        to chapter, etc. is easy and fast as well,.  One is also able to
                                        print materials easily. This is possible through what is known as
                                        <i>Hypermedia</i> or <i>Hypertext</i>. These terms will be discussed much further in
                                        Unit 2 of this module.

                                        Other resources which can be found in the digital library include magazines,
                                        journals, music files, video/DVD files and many more. All these can be
                                        accessed (downloaded) where there is free access, or where there is restriction
                                        and you have to pay for time or subscribe (sometimes free subscription are
                                        available but sometimes one has to pay). Teachers can be able to download Open
                                        Education Resources (OER's) from different locations on the net. While ICTs have

                                        In developing countries there are various social problems which
                                        create barriers to people (schools included) owning and using
                                        telecommunications and ICTs. These problems, amongst others, include
                                        finances, illiteracy, cultural barriers, lack of telecommunications
                                        infrastructure, lack of computer skills and technological know-how.
                                        Others include lack of access to computers and computer networks as
                                        a result of the digital divide. This amounts to no Internet access and
                                        lack of significant usage opportunities.

                                        With the lack of computer skills for many teachers, a number of interventions
                                        need to be put in place such as re-training/in-service training, etc.
                                        For starters, this problem can be remedied once telecommunication
                                        infrastructures have been established in their areas of residence.
                                        In addition,  teachers need to have access to computers and the internet
                                        and be capacitated to have the necessary computer skills.

                                        Other constraints to ICTs in rural areas for example, include the relying
                                        on physical infrastructures which may not work properly. These include
                                        electricity and poor telecommunications. Even when such infrastructures
                                        are in place, difficulties arise when they are poorly maintained or too costly
                                        to use. Teachers therefore are urged to use what is available cautiously, or
                                        improvise where possible so that learners can benefit from the cast technologies
                                        which are in place. In the next section, we will look at social media which is linked to ICTs

                                        To understand how technology fits into instruction, we need first to have a

                                        learning, and the instructional events that

                                        students. As a teacher, you need a clear understanding of key teaching and

                                        One of the things that you might have noted from your reading is the definition of terms like "teaching" and "learning".
                                        Nacino-Brown et al (1982:2) have defined teaching as <i>
                                            "an attempt to help someone acquire, or change some skills, attitude,
                                            or knowledge".
                                        </i>In other words, the teacher influences
                                        desirable change in the behaviour of the learner.
                                        The goal of teaching is to bring about desired learning in
                                        the student. The aim of teaching is to help individuals learn.
                                        Teaching can also be defined as a systematic, planned sequence of
                                        events that facilitates the communication of ideas, concepts or skills
                                        to a learner (Lever-Duffy, J.; McDonald, J.B.; Mizell, A.P. (2005).
                                        The act of teaching requires an understanding of learning and of
                                        the individual as well as understanding of environmental factors that affect the learner.
                                        This calls for imagination on the part of the teacher by selecting relevant content, using
                                        the most effective methods and materials and organizing the learning the environment in a way
                                        that learners interact with the content and helps to bring about the desired behaviour.

                                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                                        Learning on the other hand is something that takes place in an
                                        individual's mind. It can never be seen or observed directly.
                                        Learning is said to have occurred whenever an individual's
                                        behaviour is modified or when a person thinks and acts differently,
                                        or when he/she has acquired new knowledge or a new skill
                                        (Kemp & Dayton, 1985:13).  According to Heinich et al (1996),
                                        <i>
                                            learning is the development of new knowledge, skills, or attitudes as an

                                        The instructional/learning process involves the selection, arrangement, and
                                        delivery of information in an appropriate environment and the way the
                                        learner interacts with that information. Usually the arrangement of
                                        information and the environment is normally the responsibility of the
                                        instructor and the designers of instructional media.  As a teacher, you need
                                        to select, arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate
                                        environment so that learners can interact with it and convert it into
                                        knowledge.

                                        For instruction to take place, instructional media are used since they form part of

                                        The best way for students to learn is for them to experience the environment firsthand.
                                        However, it is not always possible to provide learners with firsthand experience as the
                                        environment becomes more complex and some compromise in form of substitute experience
                                        must be developed.  The teacher will need to select and use appropriate media that could
                                        provide substitute experience.  Therefore, instructional media form part of the classroom
                                        communication process and play a vital role in the learning process.

                                        Earlier on, we defined instruction as the arrangement of information and environment to
                                        facilitate learning. That transmission or transfer of information from a source to a
                                        destination is called <strong>communication</strong>.   Since new learning usually depends on taking
                                        in new information, effective instruction cannot take place unless communication takes
                                        place. Therefore, we need to understand the communication process so that we can use
                                        educational technology effectively during instruction.

                                        The word 'communication' has its origin from a Latin word, <i>"communis"</i> which means,
                                        <i>"make common"</i>. This could be stretched to mean, 'create a common ground for understanding' or
                                        share with others an idea, concept, or information. Communication could also be defined as
                                        <i>an attempt to persuade people or influence them with intent</i>. Communication is the process
                                        through which information is passed from one person to another.

                                        As a teacher, you are basically a communicator. You have ideas and information to
                                        share with your students so that they know these. You need to make a deliberate effort
                                        to influence the students to perceive the ideas and information the same way you do.
                                        This means that you have to follow a process that will help you to share the ideas and
                                        the information with your students. That process is called communication.

                                        As mentioned previously, communication is the process through which ideas, information,
                                        or skills are passed from a source to a receiver as intended. Communication does not
                                        occur unless the person receiving the message interprets it as intended. This means that
                                        both the source and the receiver must share a common understanding of the message when
                                        communication takes place.   Communication as a process consists of several elements.
                                        These elements include:

                                        <kk>The source</kk> encodes the message that is conveyed to the receiver.
                                        The source could be you as the teacher or it could be your students.
                                        To encode the message and convey it as intended to the target audience,
                                        the source must have the following characteristics:

                                            <li>Possess the necessary communication skills such as speaking, reading, writing, and listening.</li>

                                                composition (either homogenous or heterogeneous group), ability level, specific entry competencies, size (how many), their experience

                                        to your target audience since whatever message you encode must be
                                        interpreted by the target audience as intended. For example, you talk
                                        and your audience listens, or you write and they read the content of the
                                        message. Make sure that your message is rooted in their experiences.

                                        message in a way that interests the audience and which they can identify with.
                                        Make the message credible and put it at the level of your audience understanding
                                        so that they can easily interpret it. The message should be receiver oriented.

                                        how the message is received and interpreted by the audience or the receiver.
                                        It is said that 'the medium is the message' because the channel that you select

                                        to confirm whether the message has been received as you intended.
                                        You should not wait to be told by the receiver whether the message
                                        has been received as intended or not. You should look for feedback
                                        and it does not always have to be verbal or spoken.  Feedback could
                                        be in form of words, expressions, gestures, or other actions (verbal and non-verbal).
                                        Feedback could also be positive or negative.  As a teacher, always be aware of the non-verbal
                                        feedback. As it is said, <i>
                                            <kk>'one cannot not communicate'</kk>.  This means that communication is always on going,
                                            it is also irreversible, irretrievable, and interdependent. What I say, or not say, or what I do, affects
                                            how you respond and what you say or do affects me but neither of us determines the behaviour of the other.

                                        Feedback helps you as the source of the message to detect where a problem might have arisen if
                                        the message has not been received as intended. It also helps you to correct any errors in the
                                        transmitted message, or to improve the encoding and transmission process or even to assist your
                                        target audience if they have a problem interpreting the message. Do not always wait to receive
                                        feedback. Look for it from your audience especially by observing the non-verbal communication cues.

                                        An additional element in a communication process is noise. Noise is any disturbance that
                                        interferes with or distorts the transmission of the message.  Noise could have a serious
                                        impact on the success or failure of communication. Noise clouds and masks information transmission
                                        to varying degrees and must be recognized as an obstacle to be overcome (Kemp & Dayton, 1985).

                                        clear and precise communication does not always occur.
                                        There are three types of variables that might interfere

                                        participation in the communication process. Such factors could
                                        include; loud noise from outside the classroom, excessive movement, poor lighting,
                                        or poor seating arrangement. This could also be caused by poor physical reception.

                                        The role of the teacher has changed since the 20<sup>th</sup> Century as the purpose of
                                        education has expanded rapidly. Goals of education have expanded and exceeded the focus
                                        of the 3Rs (Reading, writing and arithmetic).  In the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, some aspects
                                        of education and teaching will remain the same, while others are changing dramatically.
                                        At the moment, teachers must be equipped with a number of skills such as the use of the
                                        Internet, as instruction can take place via the Internet through what is known as E-learning.

                                        As well, there are many developments in using technology for instructional purposes. In some

                                        Let us briefly look at some of the areas where change might or has occurred:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>

                                                Tremendous changes are/have occurred in the way information is stored and accessed with computers
                                                and digital technologies. Today, the Internet is connecting students to a wide range of resources
                                                for learning, which were previously not available.  Arends (2007:7) argues that the Internet will
                                                become (if it has not already) the primary medium of/for information and will substantially redefine
                                                other forms of print and visual publications. This in turn will cause educators to redefine how they
                                                conduct their lessons and the assignments they give in class.  As educators worldwide expand the use of
                                                technology in teaching and learning, it is becoming evident that technology will end up doing more than
                                                just enhancing instruction. It might prove to be a serious force in changing the nature and form of instruction.

                                        Consider the case of the cell phone, which has completely changed the nature of personal, and business communication.
                                        Like the cellular technology, educational technologies are essentially communication tools and any advances in
                                        educational technologies will fundamentally alter the way in which we communicate educationally.
                                        Another example is in distance education courses like the one you are currently enrolled in. A major
                                        characteristic of distance education programmes is the physical separation between the instructor and
                                        the learners for most of the time. So, such programmes are offered through various combinations of digital
                                        and other distance delivery technologies.

                                                Education in the past was organized in such a manner that the teacher's role was
                                                to transmit information or 'the truth' to students. Teachers were regarded as
                                                experts whose duty was to pass information to the students who were passive listeners.
                                                It is now believed that knowledge is personal and meaning is constructed by the learner
                                                through experience. Therefore, learning is a social and cultural activity in which learners
                                                construct their own meaning by interacting with the information and by being actively involved
                                                in the process of creating meaning. This is what has come to be described as <i>
                                                    'constructivist learning'.

                                                </i> is a perspective in teaching and learning in which a learner constructs
                                                meaning from experience and interaction with others where the role of the teacher is to provide
                                                meaningful experiences for students (Arends 2007: Glossary: 3).

                                        According to Heinich et al. (1996:18), the ultimate measure of learning is based on
                                        the ability of the student to use knowledge to facilitate thinking in real life.
                                        From the constructivist perspective, learning is viewed as a process where students
                                        are actively engaged in relevant experiences with opportunities for dialogue so that
                                        meaning can evolve and be constructed.    Learning takes place not in passive classrooms
                                        but in communities characterized by high levels of learner participation and engagement.
                                        This will imply that teachers will have to change the way they plan and organize instruction.
                                        Teachers will no longer be the source of information but will act as facilitators by providing
                                        opportunities and resources for students to interact with and construct their own meanings.
                                        This will imply that teachers will have to make support technologies such as E-mail, Internet,
                                        Web sites and Electronic Conferences available for students to use.

                                        In your answer you might need to consider the new technologies that have invaded
                                        the classroom and how their utilization might affect the way teachers have traditionally
                                        communicated with students in class. Explain the demands placed on teachers as they facilitate
                                        students to learn using the emerging technologies.

                                            In this unit we focused
                                            on understanding what
                                            educational technology
                                            was and we also defined some
                                            of the terms that are closely
                                            associated with educational technology.
                                            We went on to discuss why we need to study educational technology.
                                            We discussed the relationship between educational technology,
                                            communication and learning. We need to understand where educational
                                            technology features or fits in, in the whole classroom communication
                                            process since we use educational technology to extend and maximise our
                                            communication efforts
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="text-justify">
                                            We also discussed the communication process in relation to learning
                                            as well as the various theories of learning.  It is important that we
                                            understand how learning takes place so that we can plan for effective teaching
                                            and learning. We concluded the unit by discussing the changing role of a teacher
                                            in classroom communication as newer technologies invade the classroom.  With this introduction,
                                            you now need to synthesize the knowledge gained into your own personal view of the teaching and
                                            learning process so that you can determine how educational technology fits into your teaching and learning.
