                            Teachers have long been known for their creative use of available tools
                            and resources to produce instructional materials. Creating your own
                            instructional materials is sometimes unavoidable in a classroom, given
                            that teachers are faced with different and unique instructional situations.
                            Since our students differ in their characteristics and learning needs,
                            available instructional materials might not always work for our own
                            situations. This calls for creativity on our part as teachers to design
                            and produce our  own instructional materials.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            So far we have discussed the various types of instructional media
                            that we could use in our teaching, but think for a moment about
                            your own classroom where you have been teaching for so many
                            years and many of these media that are available. Answer honestly,
                            <i>
                                'How much of media materials have you used over the past few years?
                                Why have you not used other media?
                            </i>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            If you think hard about the reason why you have not used some of the media,
                            the main reason is that some media are not readily available. So, if
                            you were a little creative, you could design and produce your own
                            instructional media to meet your instructional needs. As a teacher
                            undergoing further training, you need to see yourself as a professional
                            teacher focused on building skills for the future. I am sure you would
                            like to make a difference in the way you will teach after furthering your
                            training, and not  continue teaching the way you have always done in the past.<br />
                            In this unit, you are not expected to become a skilled instructional technologist or a
                            media specialist by making your own teaching materials. This would be unrealistic given
                            the limited training you will have acquired at the end of this course and the limited
                            facilities available in the schools where you teach. Admittedly the instructional
                            materials are very scarce in our classrooms yet we all want to improve the way we
                            help our students learn by enriching the learning environment with appropriate
                            instructional media and materials.  Therefore, we have to be creative as teachers
                            in order to make our instructional environment more interesting and motivating.

                            In this unit we will therefore introduce you to the concepts
                            of designing, planning and producing instructional materials
                            to meet your instructional goals. We will discuss the process
                            for designing instructional materials so that you can be in

                            Instructional design is the component of the process that helps you to think
                            strategically about the teaching and learning experience you are targeting.
                            It helps you to articulate every essential ingredient in the teaching-learning
                            process. It paints the bigger-picture version of instruction that results in a
                            complete and precise blueprint of what should happen and how.<br />
                            Designing instructional materials deals with creative thinking and an analysis
                            of how the creative thinking process is successfully used. What is also revealed

                            Now let us consider each purposes in more detail.<br /><br />

                            For <kk>motivational purposes</kk>, dramatic or entertainment techniques may be employed.
                            The desired result is to generate interest or stimulate learners to take certain action.
                            This should involve accomplishing objectives that affect personal attitudes, values, and emotions.<br /><br />

                            For <kk>informational purposes</kk>, the instructional media would be used
                            in a presentation made before a group of learners. The content and form of
                            the presentation would be general in nature, serving as an introduction,
                            an overview, a report, or background knowledge. It could therefore employ
                            either entertainment, dramatic, or motivational techniques in order to attract
                            and hold learners' attention. Usually, when viewing informational-type materials,
                            the individuals tend to be passive viewers or listeners.<br /><br />

                            For <kk>instructional purposes</kk>, while presentation of information is important,
                            attention is also given to involving the participants or the students in our case in
                            either mental or overt activities relating to the instructional media being used so that
                            learning can take place.  The materials themselves should be designed more systematically
                            in terms of learning principles in order to provide effective instruction but at the same time,
                            they should be enjoyable and provide pleasant experiences. It is desirable to make provision for
                            the individual learner to use instructional media on their own.

                            Once you have formulated an idea, <i>

                                planned learning within an instructional context.

                            learn in a particular lesson. This is stated in terms of
                            instructional/learning objectives. Instructional/learning objectives
                            provide clear guidance that allows an orderly presentation of content leading to learning.<br /><br />

                            To provide for the desired learning, objectives are stated to indicate the outcomes of the learning.
                            Objectives are grouped into three broad categories, namely; cognitive which focuses on knowledge and
                            information and is represented by thinking and other intellectual skills, psychomotor which focuses on
                            performance skills, and affective which focuses on attitudes and values.<br /><br />


                            Depending on the content to be taught, you formulate objectives
                            to address each one of the broad learning domains.    For example,
                            you might state your instructional objectives to address the following learning outcomes:

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Help learners to apply certain steps in a given process;</li>
                                <li>Help learners to practice a certain skill or attitude</li>
                                <li>Help learners to respond to a certain social need.  </li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            Your design process should also consider the audience or the learner.
                            You need to be aware of the learner characteristics such as age, educational
                            level, knowledge of the subject matter, attitudes towards the subject, cultural
                            context of the learners, the number of learners in class, and individual differences
                            within the group.  Audience characteristics influence you as you consider the ideas to be
                            presented, level of learner involvement, and degree of participation.<br /><br />

                            Finally, obtain assistance from persons who have special knowledge and skills
                            relating to the materials being developed or on similar developed materials.
                            Such people might include computer experts, communication specialists, or instructional designers.<br /><br />

                            Please note that just like there is no single recipe to creating effective instruction,
                            there are different ways of creating learning experiences. However, the following
                            procedure could guide you in this process.<br /><br />

                            Designing a visual display begins with gathering or producing the individual pictorial
                            and text elements that will be used in the display.   At this stage, it is assumed that
                            you have already determined the students' needs and interests regarding the topic to be
                            taught and have decided on the objectives to be achieved through the visuals that you

                            In your visual design, you need to consider how you will achieve the visual design goal,

                            The type of visuals selected for a particular situation depends
                            on the learning task. For example, based on Dale's Cone of Experience
                            that we discussed in Unit 2, visual symbols can be divided into three
                            categories, namely; realistic, analogic, and organizational (Houghton & Willows, 1987).

                            <i>Realistic</i> visuals show the actual object under study. The degree
                            of realism can be heightened by use of realistic colours, which is one of
                            the major purposes that colour serves. The realistic visual is the closest
                            it thing to the original.<br /><br />

                            <i>Analogic</i> visuals convey a concept or topic by showing something else
                            and implying a similarity. Teaching about electricity flow by showing water
                            flowing in series and parallel pipes is an example of using analogic visuals.
                            Such visuals help the learner to interpret new information in light of prior
                            knowledge and in that way facilitating learning.<br /><br />

                            <i>Organizational</i> visuals include flowcharts, graphs, maps, classification charts,
                            etc. They are mainly used to show relationships among concepts or points in textual material.

                            <kk><i>Verbal Elements</i></kk><br />
                            These refer to lettering style and location. Most displays incorporate some type of
                            verbal information in addition to visuals. When evaluating a display for its
                            instructional potential, or in preparing your own display, you need to consider
                            the lettering as it can add to effective communication effectively too.
                            At a minimum, ensure that lettering is legible in terms of size and spacing
                            and that the style is consistent with the intended message.<br /><br />

                            <i>Letter Style</i><br />
                            The lettering style should be consistent and in harmony with the other elements
                            of the visual. For informational and instructional purposes, a plain (not decorative)
                            lettering style is recommended. It is recommended that a display -or series of related
                            visuals, such as a slide series-use no more than two different types of styles, which
                            should be in harmony with each other.<br /><br />

                            For best legibility, use lowercase letters, adding capitals or uppercase only where
                            normally required. The colour of the lettering should contrast with the background
                            colour for purposes of legibility since legibility depends on contrast.<br /><br />

                            <i>Size of letters</i><br />
                            Displays such as bulletin boards are meant to be viewed by people situated at a
                            distance of about ten (10) meters. In such cases, the size of letters is crucia
                            l for legibility. A common rule of thumb is to make lowercase letters 1.2
                            centimeters for each four (4) meters of viewer distance.<br /><br />

                            <i>Spacing between letters</i><br />
                            The distance between the letters of the individual words must be
                            judged by experience rather than on mechanical basis since
                            some letters are irregular compared to others.<br /><br />

                            <i>Spacing between lines</i><br />
                            Vertical spacing between lines is also important for legibility.
                            If the lines are too close together, they blur the distance and if
                            they are too far apart, they will seem disjointed. For equal spacing,
                            start by drawing lines of equal distance using a ruler. This will help
                            you get used to even line spacing.<br /><br />

                            <i>Elements that Add Appeal</i><br />
                            Your visuals will have a slim chance of having an effect unless
                            they capture and hold the viewer's attention. How can you achieve this?

                                    <i>Surprise</i>. Consider what grabs attention. You will need
                                    to provide novel stimuli every time in order to sustain
                                    the attention of the viewers.

                                    <i> Texture </i>- most visuals are two-dimensional but
                                    you could add a third dimension with the use of
                                    texture or actual materials. For example, you
                                    could use cereal grains to design a map of
                                    Swaziland that will appear like it has a
                                    third dimension.

                                    <i>Interaction </i>. Viewers can be asked to respond to visual
                                    displays by manipulating materials on the display to answer
                                    questions raised by the display. For example, you can prepare
                                    a visual display to show different parts or components, and
                                    then prepare some cards with names for students to align the
                                    correct part or component with the appropriate name.
                                </li>

                        </p>

                            <kk><i>Pattern</i></kk><br />
                            Once you have made decisions on the elements to include
                            in your visual display, you should then decide on how the
                            viewer's eyes will flow across the display. This is what
                            can be described as 'pattern'. Pattern is influenced by;
                            alignment, shape, balance, style, colour scheme and colour appeal.<br /><br />

                            <i>Alignment</i> refers to positioning of elements to give a clear visual relationship
                            to each other in order to aid understanding and interpretation. Viewers will perceive
                            elements to be aligned when the edges of those elements are aligned on the same imaginary
                            horizontal and vertical line.  These imaginary lines should be parallel to the edges of the display.<br /><br />

                            <i>Shape</i>-Visuals should be arranged to present a shape that is familiar to the viewers.
                            Use a pattern that attracts and focuses attention as effortless as possible. For example
                            circles, rectangles, or tri-angles provide a convenient framework, as the shape is predictable to the viewers.<br /><br />

                            <i>Colour scheme</i>- as you choose colour, consider the harmony of the colours. Any two
                            colours that lie directly opposite each other on the colour wheel are called complementary
                            colours such as red and green, or yellow and violet.   <kk>Complementary colours</kk> harmonize well
                            in terms of overall colour scheme. Colours that lie next to each other on the colour wheel
                            are called <kk>analogous colours</kk>. For instance, blue-green, blue, and blue-violet are analogous
                            colours. Colour appeal is also important. Artists appreciate that blue, green, and violet are
                            cool colours while red and orange are considered warm colours. When choosing colour for
                            instructional materials, consider the emotional response that you are seeking.

                            <kk><i>Arrangement</i></kk><br />
                            You should arrange items within the pattern as viewers assume
                            that elements close together are related and those that are far
                            apart are unrelated. If a display includes verbal labels for the
                            picture elements, connect the related words and pictures clearly.<br /><br />

                            <kk><i>Consistency</i></kk><br />
                            If you are planning a series of displays such as a set of overhead
                            transparencies or PowerPoint slides, you should be consistent in
                            the arrangement of elements.

                            When you plan and design your visuals you could use visual planning tools
                            such as <kk><i>story boarding and lettering stencils and guides.</i></kk>  Storyboarding is
                            a technique borrowed from film and video production that allows you to creatively
                            arrange and rearrange your sketches.  In storyboarding, a sketch or a simple representation
                            of the visuals you plan to use is put on a card or a piece of paper along with the narration.
                            After a series of cards have been developed, they are placed in a rough sequence on a flat surface
                            or on a storyboard holder. You can use small pieces of paper to create your storyboard.
                            The individual storyboard cards or papers can then be divided into areas to accommodate
                            the visuals, narration and production notes. The format of a storyboard should fit your
                            need and purpose.<br /><br />

                            A wide variety of lettering techniques for visuals exist. The simplest is freehand
                            lettering with markers and felt-tip pens which come in an array of colours. Letters
                            can also be cut from construction paper or other materials. Pre- cut letters are
                            available in stationery and office supply stores.  These letters are easy to use as
                            they come with an adhesive backing. You could also purchase lettering guides from stationery
                            stores. Desktop publishing systems also frequently use lettering in various styles and sizes.

                            Graphics is an art form where ideas are expressed in diagrams, pictures, graphs,
                            charts, collages and posters. Much of graphic material is made for display on
                            bulletin boards, flannel boards and chalkboards. If you think about it hard enough,
                            you will realize that graphics are part of our everyday life. After all wedo
                            see graphics on the billboards, on TV commercials, on clothes, etc. Graphics
                            attempt to express or convey a thought, impression or point of view.   Much of
                            the graphic media is not only useful as motivational materials but also, you and
                            your students can easily create them.<br /><br />

                            Posters in particular are very effective in promoting school activities, campaigns and
                            special events. You could follow the design procedure that we have discussed earlier on
                            to design your own posters. Remember that posters rely on use of symbols to express certain ideas,
                            lettering and colour.  One form of poster that you could involve your students in creating <kk><i>is collage</i></kk>.
                            A collage is an art form that uses layers and textures of materials to portray a symbolic picture.
                            Materials for making collage could be obtained from pictures, cloth, newspapers, magazines etc.

                            The process for designing text is similar to that of designing visuals. Once
                            you have created your message, you will need to assemble the elements. Remember
                            that text is designed using word processing from your computer.<br /><br />

                            Just like in visuals, choose the background and underlying pattern. Do not
                            skimp on the page margins, as pages that are too full, too dense, cluttered
                            or too disorganized are discouraging to readers.  Remember that paragraphs
                            are aligned at the left margin, not at the right margin or at both margins;
                            the left margin alignment provides best readability.<br /><br />

                            Next, arrange the elements. Use space by moving elements closer together
                            or further apart before using styles like bold, italic, or underlined text.
                            Use text styles to reinforce the underlying pattern of the document. For
                            example, make subheadings bold and nothing else bold.  Note that on a
                            vertical dimension, you need to decide on the spacing between lines of
                            text, between the title and other text, and between text and subheadings.<br /><br />

                            Note that titles may be aligned with the left margin or centred on the page.
                            If you centre the title, take care that it looks centred and not simply misaligned.
                            The subheadings should be aligned with each other, if they are centred each one
                            appears to be aligned differently and the viewer may have trouble identifying them.
                            All regular text should be aligned at the same margin except for lists and block
                            quotations.<br /><br />

                            After word processing you need to check and revise the text.
                            Check whether the titles and subheadings take up more than one
                            line and make sure that the phrases on each line make sense. Move blocks
                            of text close to their subheadings and away from other text on the page.
                            Use of space helps the viewer make sense of the page easily and quickly.
                            Always spell-check your work and ensure that words that  will make sense
                            to a reader and facilitate understanding.

                            The chalkboard is probably the most widely used media display in the classroom since
                            even the most disadvantaged schools at least has a chalkboard. It is also the easiest
                            media to use either for writing or for displaying other types of media. To make the
                            chalkboard an effective instructional media also requires planning, and effective
                            chalkboard techniques require practice. Use of the chalkboard is not likely to make
                            a poor teacher a good teacher, but its appropriate use can make both poor teachers
                            and good teachers better.<br /><br />

                            Therefore, think before you write or draw on the chalkboard
                            to consider what you want to show, and how best to present it.<br /><br />

                            <kk>Role of the chalkboard during instruction</kk><br />
                            The chalkboard can be used to prepare drawings or writing. You can draw your diagrams or
                            illustrations in advance before the class commences and then keep it covered and only
                            reveal it when you want to talk about that particular content or refer to the diagram
                            for illustration.  Colour should also be used as a way of motivating students and helping
                            to emphasize specific aspects of the lesson.

                                    Make your chalkboard work readable. Whatever you write should
                                    be read even from the back of the class. This is achieved by
                                    producing bold, clear lines and letter characters. Spacing is
                                    critical in achieving readable writing. Spacing refers to
                                    regulation of distance between elements of a letter, letters
                                    in a word, words in a line, and between successive lines
                                    in a piece of writing.   Spacing determines the shape of
                                    the letters. To ensure good, legible letters, the space
                                    between the downward strokes of letters like <i><kk>u</kk></i>,
                                    and the breadth of letters like <i><kk>o</kk></i> must have
                                    uniform appearance.

                                    The spacing of letter elements should be constant.
                                    Letters and the spacing between the letters should
                                    be uniform and when forming a word, letters should
                                    be written close together to ensure legibility.

                                    Legibility of words is affected by excessively
                                    small spaces. Successive lines of writing must
                                    also be properly spaced for good legibility.

                            The Whiteboard is a new generation form of the chalkboard. It is called whiteboard
                            as it is normally white. One of the reasons being that not only can one write on
                            it, but it can also be used as a screen for projection purposes. Special marker
                            pens are used to write on the whiteboard and can easily be erased. One should
                            never use a Permanent Marker on the white board as it cannot be easily erased.
                            Materials can also be pinned on the whiteboard for display to the learners. Below
                            we will now look at another type of whiteboard known as "Smart Board".<br /><br />

                            The Smart Board is an interactive whiteboard that uses touch detection for user input
                            (for example scrolling and right mouse-click) in the same way as normal PC input devices
                            such as mice or keyboards. A projector is used to display a computer's video output onto
                            the whiteboard, which then acts as a huge touchscreen.

                                It is advisable to follow a practical procedure when designing
                                overhead transparencies. The procedure includes:
                            </kk>
                            <ul>

                                    Follow the design principles presented to
                                    you under the sub-topic on designing visuals.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Assemble the elements. When you are choosing
                                    elements, remember that viewers will stop reading
                                    text once they know what it says, but will continue
                                    looking at illustrations, especially when they are
                                    talking about them. Therefore, use more graphical
                                    elements than text in your transparencies and
                                    supply verbal explanations yourself. Include text
                                    for key ideas only. If you are using write-on
                                    transparencies, make sure that you leave enough
                                    margins for the frame.
                                </li>

                                    Choose background and underlying pattern.
                                    The title area should be at the top where viewers
                                    begin to scan the display. Content area should be
                                    limited to 1 or 2 images at most for graphical
                                    displays and at most 6 bullet points for text display.
                                    If you are using computer generated transparencies, you
                                    could select a template for the underlying pattern.

                                    Arrange the elements. Since the elements in a transparency
                                    should be fairly large in order to project well, the challenge
                                    is to fit the elements into the available space. In case you
                                    have information that could be presented in a certain sequence,
                                    you might consider designing <kk><i>overlays</i></kk> where the

                            It is important to know how you can design Power Point
                            presentations nowadays since the world has become digitalized.
                            The following points will help you get organized.

                            <kk>1. Plan your content first</kk><br />
                            Many people start the process of creating a presentation in PowerPoint
                            by entering text on the slides. This is not a good idea. The content
                            should drive the design. So the most important recommendation is to plan
                            your content first.<br /><br />

                            Always start your presentation on paper or word processor - draw your ideas
                            and link relationships between concepts. Ask yourself these important questions
                            before creating your presentation.<br />
                            <ol>
                                <li>What is the purpose of my presentation? </li>
                                <li>What do I want my audience to do because of the presentation? </li>
                                <li>What message do I want to deliver that will help me achieve that purpose?</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme">
                            <kk>2. Use a plain background and remove any unnecessary detail</kk>
                            When it comes to slide design, you should not think of decoration, but of
                            communication. Everything you add to your slides should add value to the
                            message you are communicating. Removing extraneous information from a screen
                            actually increases learning.<br /><br />

                            <kk>3. One idea per slide</kk>
                            Use each slide to express one idea. You can completely transform your presentation
                            from boring bullets to high impact visuals by putting one point on a slide. Something
                            as simple as having only one main idea per slide makes a big difference. Fewer words on
                            each slide will attract more attention and create a lasting impact.<br /><br />

                            <kk> 4. Support the headline with graphic evidence</kk>
                            Instead of bullets, support your points with graphic evidence. This can include
                            <i>photos, images, charts and diagrams</i>. Say the words and put
                            the visuals on your slides. Support your points with creative and
                            relevant images.

                            <kk>5. You don't always need a slide</kk>
                            Not every point in your presentation needs a slide. You only need a
                            visual aid in a presentation if you would need one in conversation.
                            Slides should be projected only when they serve the presentation.
                            When you are not showing a slide, insert a plain black slide into
                            your slideshow.<br /><br />

                            For example you can use flip charts with or without PowerPoint;
                            flip charts can be used to sketch out an idea, get input from
                            the audience or provide a group activity to keep a presentation
                            lively. In this case, there is movement, there is interaction,
                            there is problem solving, and the activity is spontaneous and
                            created on the spot.<br /><br />

                            <kk>6. Put detail in the handouts</kk>
                            Create handouts that are distributed after the presentation.
                            Your handouts are the repository for detailed information.

                            Audio media materials can easily be designed and produced by both the teacher and
                            students since all that you need is an audio tape recorder and blank audiotape. Audio media
                            can be effective during instruction especially to achieve motivational, informational or
                            instructional purposes of teaching and learning.  Audio media is effective in teaching
                            many of the subjects offered in the school curriculum. For example, teaching of literature
                            either in English, French or African languages like siSwati. Audio media is also appropriate
                            in English Language, especially in drama. You can also use audio media to individualize instruction
                            particularly when you have slow learners in your class or when you are teaching complex topics that
                            students have difficulties understanding .<br />
                            To design and produce audio materials, the following procedure will be followed:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Formulate an instructional goal. Decide what you want to achieve by
                                    using audio media. Is it  for motivation, information
                                    sharing or for instruction?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Formulate the instructional objectives that will form the basis
                                    of the audio programme to be produced.
                                    What do you want to achieve?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Select the content to be presented and decide on the scope of
                                    content coverage. It is recommended that an ideal audio programme
                                    should only run for fifteen (15) minutes. Therefore, if you have a
                                    lot of content to be covered prepare a series of audio programmes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Prepare a recording script. A script is an outline description of
                                    the content to be presented and prepared in a format that will be
                                    used for reading as opposed to talking. A script identifies even
                                    the presenters or the people who will be involved in the presentation
                                    of content and the actual content that they read. As you prepare a
                                    recording script, consider how you will involve the learners in
                                    meaningful learning activities.  Remember that audio media appeals
                                    only to the sense of hearing; therefore to captivate the students'
                                    attention requires that they get engaged in some activities as they
                                    listen to the recorded materials.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To captivate the attention of the listeners, make sure that you
                                    provide variety through appropriate sound effects, music, short
                                    dialogue and voices of experts in your field.  All these might
                                    be included in the script that you prepare since all presenters
                                    need to know in advance whatever they will be required to say
                                    during the recording.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Be creative in your script writing and be conversational.
                                    Since audio media is meant for listening, converse with
                                    the audience as you would normally converse with a friend.
                                    Explore the content with the students rather than lecturing
                                    to them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As you present the materials, direct the students' attention
                                    to whatever will be discussed before discussing it. Inform
                                    the students what to pay attention to as they listen to the
                                    audiotape.  For example, if they have to refer to a certain
                                    diagram, instruct them what to look for or observe and give
                                    them time during the presentation to do exactly that.
                                    This means that you will need to pause occasionally for
                                    students to carry out specific tasks or activities that
                                    you will identify for them.  When you pause the tape, provide
                                    a music interlude for students to know that the presentation
                                    is still continuing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When the presentation ends, it is useful to summarize
                                    the key points or ideas covered during the lesson.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Finally prepare some follow -up activities for the
                                    students to assist in learning transfer and to
                                    reinforce what will have been presented
                                </li>

                            publishing it on your blog. The first step therefore is for
                            you to have created a blog. Visitors to your blog simply
                            select a link on your blog, turn on their computer speakers

                            To record a podcast, you need to have a microphone that is compatible with your computer.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 2: Get audio software.</i><br />
                            Once you have a microphone, you need to get software that allows you to record audio through
                            that microphone and save it on your computer's hard drive. Free audio software can be downloaded
                            from <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>  Once on the website,
                            follow instructions to download the
                            software. Otherwise if the software is available on the e-learning website, you could then use it.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 3: Prepare your podcast content.</i><br />
                            Take some time to think about what you are going to say during your podcast. You can
                            even write a script based on a particular topic. If it is an assignment, then your
                            recording should be based on the assignment.<br /><br />


                            <i>Step 4: Record your podcast.</i><br />
                            Turn on your microphone, start your audio software and begin recording.
                            Save the file when you are done.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 5: Upload your podcast file to your online host.</i><br />
                            Upload your podcast file to your web host. If you plan to record a lot
                            of podcasts or your blog gets a lot of traffic, you might want to create
                            a new hosting account to hold your podcasts, so you do not reach your blog
                            hosting bandwidth limits too quickly. Instructions for uploading the podcast
                            may be given on the e-learning website.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 6: Get the URL of your uploaded podcast file.</i><br />
                            Once you upload your podcast file to your hosting account, copy the
                            podcast URL and keep that URL handy as you will have to paste it in your blog.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 7: Create a new blog post.</i><br />
                            Open your blogging application and create a new blog post. Give it a title and
                            add any text you would like to introduce your podcast.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 8: Paste the URL for your podcast file into your new blog post.</i><br />

                            Using the URL you copied earlier for your uploaded podcast file, paste that information
                            into your new blog post as new media or a new enclosure link, depending on the blogging
                            application you use.<br /><br />

                            <i>Step 9: Publish your new blog post.</i><br />
                            Select the publish button in your blogging application to send
                            your new blog post with your podcast link included live online.<br /><br />



                            <i>Step 10: Test your podcast link.</i><br />
                            Open your new live blog post and select your podcast link to ensure it is working correctly.<br /><br />

                            The last tool or software we are going to discuss in this module is Skype.
                            Skype is used as a communication tool through short messages, audio, and video calls.

                            thing to keep in mind at all times however is that
                            appropriate materials selected for a particular task

                            In this section we are going to discuss how we can utilize printed materials
                            effectively during instruction. As we mentioned in Unit 2, printed materials
                            are among the most commonly used form of instructional materials in most classrooms.
                            In spite of the recent public fascination with new electronic media, it is unlikely
                            that printed materials will ever be eliminated as a vehicle of instruction and it
                            will always have an important role to play in instruction. Admittedly, the current
                            spreading trend towards electronic communication (e-mail systems, Database Networks,
                            and World Wide Web Hypermedia such as; Portable Document Formats (PDF), and Hyper Text
                            Mail Language (Html), have just added several new media of transmission for printed messages
                            and they have also added to the amount of reading that a typical person can cope with
                            (Romiszowski, 1988:128).<br /><br />

                            The role of printed materials is being enhanced by information revolution and the days
                            of printed media are far from being over. However, this does not suggest that printed
                            materials are used effectively and efficiently during instruction. In-fact, quite often
                            instructors abuse printed materials during instruction. The abuse of printed materials
                            results from the ease with which printed materials can be obtained, reproduced and circulated
                            which often leads to their excessive and inappropriate use in the instructional process.<br /><br />

                            It is strongly recommend that you use printed materials correctly during instruction.
                            Teachers need to follow the correct procedure for utilizing instructional materials.<br /><br />

                            The following types of printed materials; <kk>
                                text books, handouts, assignment sheets, individualized
                                study materials, word processed documents, and work sheets
                            </kk>. Let us consider each of these types in more detail.

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify meme ml-5">
                            <kk>Text books</kk> - These are versatile and provide random access to the message
                            that it contains and users are able to control the process by which they gain the
                            information that they seek. Text books are relatively cheap compared to other types
                            of media. They are also durable, and easily accessible. They are portable, and fairly
                            economical to buy and maintain. As we mentioned in Unit 2, text books can be used either
                            as basic text or as chief sources of information for a particular class level and subject,
                            as a core-basic text with two or more other titles complementing each other, or as
                            supplementary and enriching source of information for a particular subject and class level.<br /><br />

                            <kk>Handouts</kk> - comprise of the different types of information-providing materials that are
                            given out to students usually in connection with a taught lesson or programme. They include; sets
                            of notes (complete or in skeleton form), tables, diagrams, maps, or any other illustrations or
                            support materials. Handouts can be used for a wide range of purposes such as; complete sets of
                            notes for specific areas of the curriculum or topic, designed to be given to students to save
                            them from having to take notes during the lesson. For example, handouts could comprise of skeleton
                            notes with blank spaces given to students to complete during the lesson or a shorter document
                            usually one sheet that is given to students to save them from having to copy complicated diagrams,
                            maps, sets of data or assist when illustrating specific concept or idea.<br /><br />

                            <kk>Assignment sheets</kk> - comprise of materials given to students describing tasks to be carried out.
                            They include; problem description sheets, reading lists, laboratory recording sheets, briefing sheets for
                            projects and seminars, etc.<br /><br />

                            <kk>Individualized study materials</kk> - comprise of the different textual materials that are used in
                            connection with individualized learning such as study guides, modules, structured notes, textual support
                            materials for mediated learning systems, etc.

                            Printed materials can play three basic roles in individualized instruction:

                                    They can be used to structure and/or control or manage the instructional process
                                    with the main instruction being carried out via other media e.g. text books.

                                    They can be used to support other individualized learning media by
                                    providing the required support such as worksheets (Ellington, 1985).

                            material, instruction sheets, data sheets, etc.<br /><br />

                            <kk>Worksheets</kk> - implies a device by which the teacher helps the students
                            to work as far as possible to his/her full capacity. A worksheet is not merely
                            an instruction sheet with one or more precise instructions, but it also includes
                            questions that even though demanding they encourage students to think for themselves
                            about the results of their work and thereafter draw conclusions.

                                    <i>Economical</i>. Printed materials are relatively inexpensive to produce,
                                    purchase and can be re-used. Text books in particular are inexpensive
                                    compared to other forms of media (Heinich, et al.: 107).

                                    <i>Individualization of instruction</i>. Printed materials allow students to
                                    proceed at their own pace. Lesson materials can be designed in a
                                    variety of ways to allow for self-paced instruction (Anderson, 1983).

                                    <i>Organization of instruction</i>. Printed materials, especially text books, help to
                                    organize instruction by providing common reading experiences, suggested learning
                                    activities, recommended readings, and questions.

                                    cross-referencing of information from different sources.

                                    practices especially through the suggestions contained in teachers'
                                    editions and in manuals.

                                    <i> Reading level</i> - Most printed materials are written at a
                                    certain reading level. It is important as a teacher to
                                    remember that some of the students in our classes are non - readers,
                                    poor readers, or lack adequate literacy skills and therefore some
                                    reading materials might be above their reading level.

                                    <i> Abuse of printed materials</i> - Printed materials, especially textbooks,
                                    can easily be abused. For example, when teachers require students to
                                    memorize many facts and definitions from a particular textbook, or
                                    when teachers use particular textbooks as the only source of information,
                                    and carry them to class in order to read from them and make notes from them.

                                    <i>  One-way presentation</i>- Some printed materials are not interactive and
                                    they tend to be used in a passive way without comprehension.
                                </li>

                                    <i> Curriculum rigidity</i> - Some textbooks dictate the curriculum
                                    rather than being used to support the it. Text books are often
                                    written to accommodate the curriculum guidelines of a particular country.

                                    <i> Vocabulary</i> - Some texts introduce a large number of vocabulary
                                    terms and concepts in a short amount of space. This places a
                                    heavy cognitive burden on students which might be overwhelming
                                    for some students (Heinich, et al.: 107-108).

                                    <i>  Presentation of information</i> - By presenting the information logically
                                    and in a pre-digested form, printed materials deny the reader the
                                    ability to think, organize the information, and arrive at independent
                                    conclusions. Hence, printed materials especially text books do not
                                    stimulate interest on the part of the user to pursue any of the
                                    information presented much further.

                                    <i> Ignore instructional innovations</i> - Printed materials rigidly prescribe
                                    and pre-arrange all learning outcomes which deny students the ability
                                    to apply knowledge into novel situations.  Most printed materials especially
                                    text books do not aim towards inquiry, problem-solving, or critical thinking.
                                    A single text books used in a particular class level is not likely to meet the
                                    varied learner abilities in a typical class.

                                    <i> Out-dated information </i>- The process of publishing printed materials particularly
                                    text books is long and involving, such that by the time a text book is published,
                                    most of the information is obsolete. This makes it difficult to keep the information
                                    contained in printed material current and up to date.

                            The most common application of printed materials is the presentation of content information
                            (Heinich et al. 1996:108).  Students are given reading assignments and held accountable for
                            the material during class discussion and on tests. Teacher-made handouts can also complement
                            a teacher's presentation or be used by students as they study independently.<br /><br />

                            Students may also use printed materials to augment either the information
                            presented by the teacher or other forms of media. Students frequently also
                            refer to supplementary printed materials such as books and journals from
                            the library or media centre to locate information on specific topics not
                            covered in their textbook.<br /><br />

                            Application of printed materials should be linked to types of learning
                            and the various learning domains, namely;<kk> cognitive, affective and psychomotor.</kk><br /><br />

                            Under cognitive learning, printed materials could sometimes (amongst many other things) be used to:

                            </ul>
                            Under psychomotor learning, printed materials can be used to:

                            </ul>
                            Under affective learning, printed materials can be used to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    provoke emotional responses in the learner through drama, visuals etc.

                            an easy job. This is due to the fact that choices are complex and
                            difficult because they are based on a combination of interrelated
                            factors such as: the abilities and learning needs of the students;

                            For you to select the most appropriate instructional media during
                            the lesson, you will need to follow the following steps:
                            <ol>
                                <li>

                                    Determine whether the purpose of your lesson is to transmit
                                    information or instruction. When a lesson involves transmission
                                    of information, the learners are not held responsible for measurable,
                                    specific actions or performance since the content is presented to give
                                    an overview of ideas, subject matter, to generate interest or to provide
                                    background information.  When a lesson involves instruction, learners are
                                    required to give demonstrable proof that they have learned and they are
                                    held responsible for the success of the lesson.  Both of these categories
                                    have sufficiently different characteristics to suggest that different
                                    media might be justified.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Determine the transmission method.  This focuses on the methods used to transmit
                                    the content to the learners. The most dominant methods are; direct instruction,
                                    indirect instruction, interactive instruction, and individualized instruction.
                                    In most cases, direct and indirect instruction are teacher-centered approaches
                                    and the most commonly used media are those which are teacher controlled while
                                    interactive and individualized instruction which are learner-centered are best
                                    presented using instructional media that are learner controlled.

                                    Determine the lesson characteristics. Once you have formulated the
                                    lesson objectives, the learning outcomes are determined and this
                                    helps you in deciding on the learning experiences that will be
                                    organized for the students. The learning experiences help in
                                    selecting the types of media to be used.

                                    Select an initial class of media. The selection of the media format
                                    depends on certain practical considerations with respect to media
                                    characteristics. Each type of medium has a number of characteristics,
                                    including special capabilities and limitations, according to the quality
                                    and type of communication you are expecting of it. For example, some media
                                    are capable of presenting information in graphic form, others are also able
                                    to communicate using graphics, but can also add an element of motion. Other
                                    media are especially made to provide sound, while other media tend to engage
                                    the learners more easily than others. Some media are economical in presenting
                                    verbal information, while others are convenient to produce, modify and revise.
                                </li>

                                    Analyse media characteristics. You need to refer to your initial choice of media
                                    and review the list of unique characteristics of each medium, its advantages and
                                    disadvantages for presenting that particular lesson content. This helps you to
                                    review your media selection and to refine the selection by either retaining the
                                    same media selection or reconsider your decision. If you decide that the initial
                                    media selection is no longer appropriate, then you have to go back and select
                                    another media format.

                            Brown et al. (1973:27) proposed some general principles in media use which are useful
                            in media-selection and decision-making. These principles should guide us as we select
                            and use media. These principles include that:
                            <ul>

                                    No one medium is best for all instructional purposes.
                                    The best choice of media depends on what type of media
                                    shows best the principle being taught. For example, if
                                    the third dimension plays an important part in communicating
                                    your message, then you should expect better results from a model.

                                    other instructional materials, three-dimensional teaching materials will

                                    teaching strategy. You need to follow some basic guidelines in their use.
                                    The following guidelines are necessary:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Be sure everyone can see them. All visuals materials being used
                                            with a group must be visible. They should be large enough to
                                            be seen easily by everyone in class.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Use three-dimensional materials in combination with other media.
                                            For example, when you use a model of a flower to explain pollination
                                            in a Biology class, you could use a large chart to show the details
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Practice using the materials before the class.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <kk>Community resources</kk><br />
                                    Did you know that the community has a wide variety of resources you could
                                    utilize for teaching and learning? Community resources include; places within
                                    the community, people, and activities and objects that are found within the
                                    community.

                            <i>People as a resource</i><br />
                            People as a resource for learning consist of professionals and
                            experienced groups. To utilize people as learning resources
                            requires proper planning. Planning entails:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Specifying the instructional objectives.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Interacting with the person either formally or informally to
                                    establish whether they will live up to the expectations of your students.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Invite the person formally to class and brief them on : the level of
                                    the class, their interests, the learning objectives, the students'
                                    expectations, time allowed for the presentation,
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Introduce the person during the presentation and be present throughout the presentation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Include a question or discussion session.

                                    Organize a follow-up activity after the presentation.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <i>Activities as a resource</i><br />
                            Activities could include; agricultural show, trade fair, exhibition,
                            religious gathering, visiting speaker, a function etc. Community activities
                            are tricky to use because they are completely out of your control as the teacher.
                            Therefore, it is important that you familiarize yourself with the contents of
                            the activity by either; attending the event prior to taking your students,
                            reading from brochures, newspapers, talking to the organizers, etc.
                            In case you decide to take the students to the activity, brief them
                            about what to look for and ask them to prepare a brief report of what
                            they saw and learned. Also if you cannot take the students, you could
                            attend the event, collect relevant literature, record the proceedings,
                            etc., and then make a presentation to your students personally.<br /><br />

                            <i>Places as a resource</i><br />
                            Places refer to locations within the community which might contain facilities
                            that could be used to demonstrate certain concepts and ideas. These could include;
                            irrigation projects, factories, markets, landforms, institutions, etc.  Trips are
                            organized to places where students can see in practice or in reality what they have
                            studied in class.  Note that Dale's cone of Experience places field trips towards
                            the middle of the cone (See sub-section 2.2.2 - Role of Media in Teaching and Learning)
                            because though the experience is real, students are only seeing and hearing but not
                            directly manipulating them. Once students undertake such trips, concepts and
                            generalizations that were difficult to formulate become clearer. Study trips
                            can be organized in any subject area for any level of students. For more
                            information on field trips, refer to school guidelines
                            (If already a practicing teacher) or access information from the Internet.<br /><br />

                            <i>Objects as a resource</i><br />
                            Objects refer to things that are found within the community which could be used to yield
                            certain learning outcomes. Objects include; artifacts, specimens, coins, etc. The procedure
                            for utilizing objects is similar to that of other media, though as a teacher you need to
                            develop the habit of collecting them from community and building a resource pool for such
                            objects so that you can select and use them at your convenience.<br />
                            To utilize community resources in general, the following procedure should apply:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Plan for the use of any community resource whether people,
                                    activities, places or objects. Planning involves formulating
                                    an instructional goal and stating the learning outcomes/objectives
                                    to be achieved by using the identified community resources.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Know the types of resources available in your community.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Consider the use of other media such as photographs, maps, video and audio recordings, etc.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Always include follow-up discussions for students to reflect on their learning experiences.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Two-dimensional visuals include pictures and graphics. Generally
                            two-dimensional visuals such as diagrams are often abstract and
                            require special background knowledge to read them. When considering
                            such visuals, a teacher needs to ask himself/herself two questions.
                            First, is the visual illustration necessary at all? Second, if it is
                            necessary, how much does the visual contribute to the understanding of
                            the content/concept or process being taught?<br /><br />

                            Graphics help to synthesize information and highlight significant elements
                            and should be used after the content/concept has been introduced.

                            A display is an organized arrangement of visual and verbal learning

                            As you preview the materials, decide how you are going to use
                            the materials, how the students will be involved, and what
                            follow-up activities to use.<br /><br />

                            <i>Prepare the Materials</i><br />
                            Before using audio materials for group presentation, practice
                            operation of the equipment. Cueing the material is important
                            to avoid delays and lost time. Prepare your introduction and
                            follow-up. If there are other materials to be used along-side
                            with the audio materials, be sure to practice first.<br /><br />

                            <i>Prepare the Environment</i><br />
                            Set up the classroom or learning environment so that all students
                            can hear the audio tape. For a large audience, avoid using a small
                            audio cassette recorder/playback. Make sure that you use good quality
                            speakers that do not distort the sound.<br /><br />

                            <i>Prepare the Learners</i><br />
                            Before playing the audio material, communicate to students
                            how the material relates to what they have studied before,
                            what they should learn from the materials, and what follow-up
                            activities will be used. If new vocabulary, or technical terms
                            are going to be presented, list them on the chalkboard, handout
                            or overhead transparency and define/ explain them before students
                            listen to the audio materials.<br /><br />

                            <i> Provide the Learning Experience</i><br />
                            Engage learners in activities during the presentation to
                            help in learning transfer. Let students carry out certain
                            learning activities as they listen. Develop audio learning
                            skills by engaging students in activities that force them to
                            listen attentively to the presentation through tasks based on
                            what they listen to and hear from the audio presentation.
                            One way of doing this is to give students a set of questions
                            to answer as they listen to the audio tape.<br /><br />

                            First you need to evaluate the purpose for which the materials

                            The first step in selecting still projection materials is deciding whether a particular
                            material serves a specific teaching purpose better than another medium or device.
                            In this case, consider the unique properties of that particular medium. The five basic

                                    logical progression? If so, transparency overlays will be the best choice

                            After selecting the type of still projection to use, then prepare
                            for the presentation. At this stage, you need to become fully acquainted
                            with the key points to be highlighted for the students. This should happen
                            when you preview the still projection.<br /><br />

                            The next step is to prepare the class by explaining to them why they are viewing
                            that particular presentation. Let students understand clearly what to look for from the projection.<br />
                            Next, make the presentation and involve the students in the actual use of media. Finally, provide some
                            follow-up activities that allow students to evaluate demonstrate and apply what they have learned.

                            Decide in advance how you will introduce the material and what follow-up activities to include.<br /><br />


                            <i>Prepare the environment</i><br />
                            Make sure that the venue for viewing the video and film is properly set, in terms of seating

                            covered content. Create a need to know among the students. Stimulate
                            curiosity by asking questions that students would like answered from the
                            video or film. Clarify the objectives of the lesson. Mention specific things
                            to look for from the presentation. If a lot of content will be presented, give
                            students some advance organizers.<br /><br />

                            <i>Provide the learning experience</i><br />
                            Observe for learner reactions. As students watch the video or film, provide
                            for learner participation. Engage students in activities that would assist in learning transfer.

                            Computer-based hypermedia can be applied in all areas of the curriculum for
                            any learning goal that is suited to individual or small group exploration of
                            a body of information. Teachers can either adapt existing materials or create
                            new materials to fill a need of their own students. Just like with other media,
                            to select and use computer-based multimedia, you need to start by analyzing the
                            audience so that whatever materials you select are able to meet the learning needs
                            of the students. Questions you should ask yourself are: <i>
                                Why do you need to use the
                                computer? What type of software are you planning to use?
                            </i> The next step is to specify
                            your instructional goal and formulate the expected learning outcomes. What do you want
                            to achieve from the Computer-Based Multimedia in terms of learning outcomes?<br /><br />

                            Currently the buzz word when it comes to web learning is E-learning or sometimes called
                            Online Learning. Through computers and other gadgets (including mobile devices) one is able
                            to learn while away from the instructor or facilitator. You may have had experience on this
                            through this course. Below we briefly look at E-learning.<br /><br />



                            <kk>What is e-learning?</kk><br />
                            E-learning has come to define  any dissemination of educational knowledge over the Internet.
                            This makes e-learning a subset of technology-based training. It also incorporates a number of learning
                            activities conducted on the Internet, of which mobile learning is one part.

                            E-learning can be real-time or self-paced, also known as "ynchronous" or
                            "asynchronous" learning. Additionally, e-learning is considered to be
                            "tethered" (connected to something) and presented in a formal and structured manner.
                            In contrast, mobile learning is often self-paced,
                            un-tethered and informal in its presentation.

                            Because mobile devices have the power to make learning even
                            more widely available and accessible, mobile devices are considered
                            by many to be a natural extension of e-learning (Ellis, 2003). We

                                In this unit we have discussed the range of media for teaching
                                and learning other than print media. We have also discussed the
                                advantages and disadvantages of using different types of media
                                during instruction. We went on to discuss how to select and use
                                different types of media during instruction.  We also discussed
                                printed materials. We identified the various types of printed
                                materials that we could use during instruction as well as the
                                advantages and disadvantages of using these.  We have also
                                discussed how to select and use different types of printed
                                materials. One important thing we have mentioned is that when
                                selecting the materials we need to consider whether the materials
                                will be used for mass instruction, group instruction or
                                individualized instruction. We concluded the unit by discussing
                                the criteria that we should use when selecting or evaluating
                                printed materials for use during instruction.
