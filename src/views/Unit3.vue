                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        So far we have discussed the range of media available to us as
                        teachers that we could use during instruction.  However, it is
                        not every media that we choose to use that would help the students
                        to learn. We need to remember that our main aim during the lesson is
                        to help students learn. You must be aware by now, that in order for
                        learning to take place, instruction may be necessary. <i>
                            Instruction refers to the
                            arrangement of information and environment to facilitate learning
                        </i>.
                        By environment, this does not just mean where instruction takes place but
                        also the methods, media and equipment that are used or are needed to guide
                        the learner's study.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        However, information and environment will change
                        depending on the instructional goal. Therefore, as
                        the expected learning outcomes also change, so must
                        the teacher change the way he/she arranges the instructional
                        environment.  For instruction to take place, instructional
                        media are used since they form part of the instructional
                        environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify meme">
                        The instructional/learning process involves the selection,
                        arrangement, and delivery of information in an appropriate
                        environment and the way the learner interacts with that
                        information. Usually the arrangement of information and the
                        environment is normally the responsibility of the instructor
                        and the designers of media.  As a teacher, you need to select,
                        arrange, and deliver the information in an appropriate environment
                        so that learners can interact with it and convert it into knowledge.<br />
                        As a teacher, you will have to decide which instructional medium or
                        media to use. To make an informed choice of medium/media from the
                        range of media that we have discussed, you need to know the advantages
                        and limitations of each medium and you need to have a selection criterion
                        that will inform your choice of media.<br />
                        This unit is therefore meant to assist you
                        in making informed decisions on your choice
                        of media during instruction.  To assist you in that regard, we will discuss
                        the criteria for media selection as well as the media selection process.
                        We will also look at some models that are used in making decisions about
                        media choices.

                                For teachers to adapt their instruction to changing
                                times and environments, they need to have a thorough
                                working knowledge of the many kinds of educational
                                technologies available that might assist in teaching
                                and enhance learning. Educational technologies are the
                                tools that a teacher might need to use in order to
                                create an effective instructional event.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify meme">
                                You need to note that it is not any media that you use that can
                                perform the required instructional role. Research indicates that
                                most media can perform most instructional functions to a certain
                                extent (Aronson, 1977; Briggs, 1968; Briggs & wager, 1981; Clark & Salomon, 1986).
                                According to Gagne, Briggs & Wager (1988), most writers on media selection models
                                agree that there is no one medium that is universally superior to all types of
                                desired outcomes and for all learners.  However, some media are better at
                                doing certain things than others and no single medium can be best for all
                                instructional situations. We therefore need to use a variety of media
                                during instruction. So, the million dollar question to ask then is,
                                <i>'what medium or media shall I use in my lesson?'</i>
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify meme">
                                As you begin your instruction, it is important to select a medium
                                that will enhance your lesson by ensuring optimal use of the media.
                                To select the most appropriate medium/media for your lesson, you will
                                need to ask yourself several questions. The following questions can guide
                                you in selecting the most appropriate media during instruction:
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify meme">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When do I use media during the lesson?</li>
                                    <li>What will the media do for my students?</li>
                                    <li>How will I select the right media?</li>
                                    <li>How will I prepare for the use of media?</li>
                                </ul>

                                Below we will try to answer each one of the questions above.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify meme">
                                <kk><i>When do I use media during the lesson?</i></kk><br />
                                You will need to use media if it will assist you to achieve your
                                lesson objective(s). Remember that media can be used at the introduction
                                to a lesson, during the lesson, or when concluding the lesson.

                                Whenever you select to use media during the lesson, remember
                                that the media has a specific role to play in that lesson.
                                Your role is to help students learn by utilizing the media
                                that you will have selected.  Active learner participation
                                enhances learning and the most effective learning situations
                                are those that require learners to perform some activities
                                building towards the lesson objectives.
                                According to Romiszowski (1988:62), media
                                selection is based on two classes of media
                                characteristics. These are the essential media characteristics
                                that control the clarity of the message, and optional media characteristics

                                Whenever you select media, it is important to consider how the
                                different media present the required stimuli for learning.
                                For example, do your students need to observe in detail the
                                phenomena being studied?  Is sound necessary for understanding?
                                Are there certain inside details that the learners need to
                                observe in order to understand how something functions or operates?
                            </p>

                                Below are the major factors that you will need
                                to consider whenever you select media for instruction:<br /><br />

                                <kk>Instructional Objectives</kk><br />
                                Your awareness of the expected learning outcomes influences the
                                choice of media. Before selecting any instructional media, always
                                ask your-self this question; <i>
                                    'What type(s) of media can help me to
                                    produce the behaviour required from the learner at the end of the
                                    instructional process?'
                                </i>

                                <kk>Nature of Content</kk><br />
                                The media that you select to use should suit the content to be delivered.
                                If for example you are teaching a lesson in Geography that focuses on World
                                Climates, you will need to use a world map to help the learners locate the
                                different regions of the world that are influenced by the different climates.
                                If you are teaching a lesson in Biology on blood circulation, you might need
                                to use a model so that students can observe the interior of the model to
                                understand how blood flows to and from the heart.

                                If in your lesson you would like the students to work together and share experiences,
                                then you cannot use a one directional medium such as audio media. Alternatively,
                                if students have to learn a certain skill and demonstration is necessary,
                                then you will need to use real media or simulations.

                                The learning tasks facing the learners influence the choice
                                of media.   For example, what type of skill do you want the
                                learners to acquire? Is it observational skills? In such a case,
                                you will need to use descriptive visuals that answer the question;
                                <i>'What do you see?'</i>

                                As you select media, you need to have a good knowledge of
                                the target audience or students. You need to know your students in terms of:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                        depend more on language or spoken word to learn, others depend on
                                        visualization, others on hands-on experiences, while others depend
                                        on logical reasoning and experimentation.

                                        for the very first time, they will require direct and concrete experiences.

                                        cultural background when selecting media because some media are interpreted
                                        based on the audience cultural experiences.

                                        to use printed materials with a group of slow learners since this would
                                        create more problems for them.

                                Media have different properties. Some media allow us
                                to transport events through time such as photographs,
                                some media create motion, and some allow interior
                                details to be observed, while other media can be
                                transported through space and reproduced anywhere,
                                such as radio and Television broadcasts allowing
                                information from a central place to be heard.
                                These are the qualities of media that we need
                                to exploit when selecting media. Each type of
                                media has certain unique advantages, which makes
                                it more suitable in meeting certain instructional
                                goals compared to others.

                                You can only use media if it is available when needed.
                                There are certain media that you might want to use but
                                you might not, either because they are not available
                                when you need them, or it is too expensive to purchase.
                                It could also be because you lack the technical capability
                                to use the media.

                                <kk>Teachers' attitudes towards media</kk><br />
                                If the teacher has phobia of a certain media, he/she is
                                unlikely to use it even when it would be the best
                                alternative for the given instructional situation.
                                Usually, attitude is linked to teachers' lack of
                                skills needed to use that particular media.
                                It is common to find that teachers will occasionally
                                choose media when it fits their teaching habits,
                                skills and preferences. For instance, teachers
                                born before the computer age might not want to
                                even learn how to use a computer because they
                                associate it with generations that came after
                                them. They will stick to using print media
                                even where the computer would do a sterling job.

                                As you select the media, also ask yourself the following question:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Will the media selected accomplish the defined task?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Is the media of the correct level of understanding for the class?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Will the media help you to achieve the expected learning outcomes?
                                    </li>

                                </ul>
                                The above criteria should guide you as you select your
                                instructional media for any instructional situation.

                                     The concept of a <i>'system'</i> refers to a dynamic and complex whole that
                                     interacts as a structured functional unit.  A system can also be defined as
                                     "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified
                                     whole". This can further be defined as "organized or established procedure".

                                     As an example, a system could be a community situated within an environment.
                                     Therefore, energy, material and information flow among different elements
                                     that compose the system via semi-permeable membranes or boundaries.
                                     Systems are often composed of entities or independent complete wholes
                                     which can exist on their own but at the same time form part of the
                                     complete whole. Hence the phrase, <i>

                                     science, health, computing, engineering, and manufacturing.
                                     In this respect, we apply the systems approach whenever we

                                     The systems approach has four key components namely:

                                             of system resources like space, time, materials and students'
                                             abilities). These analyses leads to a statement of the problem
                                             in terms of the overall objectives.

                                     have a video clip that shows a needed visual sequence but the audio
                                     portion of the video is inappropriate because it is too advanced for
                                     the students. In such a case, you might show the video with the sound
                                     turned off and then provide a narration yourself. Similarly,
                                     you could use a simulation game format but then change the
                                     rules of play either to increase or decrease the level of sophistication.

                                     when choosing media. Several media selection models
                                     have been used. Among them include what is called <kk>the basic model</kk>.

                                     This model is based on the application of a systems approach. A systems
                                     approach is a procedural way of thinking about problems in education.
                                     A systems approach can be defined as; <em>
                                         'an overall approach that
                                         involves tackling problems in a disciplined manner keeping priorities
                                         in mind. The sub-system making up the overall system can be designed,
                                         fitted, checked, and operated so as to achieve the overall objective
                                         efficiently (Rowntree, 1974).

                                     A system can also be described as the sum total of interrelated parts
                                     working together to form a complete whole. For example, a car or the
                                     human body is a system. Even an institution like the University of Swaziland
                                     (UNISWA) is a system.  A system contains certain elements; i.e. inputs,
                                     outputs, environment, sub-systems, etc.  Any system receives inputs
                                     from the environment and gives out outputs after they have been processed.
                                     However, within a system, there are sub-systems which function independently
                                     of each other. When the sub-systems combine together, they form a complete
                                     whole. It is therefore argued, according to the systems thinking, that the
                                     whole is greater than the sum total of its parts put together. Inputs,
                                     outputs and processes are defined in relation to each other, as a change
                                     in one will affect all other parts.<br /><br />
                                     In a systems approach, each decision is justified in terms of pre-planned
                                     objectives.

                                             your learners to achieve at the end of the instruction,
                                             write your goal and objectives. When writing objectives
                                             take into consideration the knowledge, skills and attitudes
                                             you expect learners to achieve. During this stage you also

                                     To use instructional media effectively requires that you apply the
                                     systems approach that we have discussed above. As we noted from the
                                     systems approach, instructional planning needs to be systematic and
                                     procedural. For example, to use instructional media effectively,
                                     there must be a match between the characteristics of the learners
                                     and the methods, media and materials. This can best be achieved by
                                     applying the ASSURE Model which is a procedural guide for planning
                                     and conducting instruction that incorporates media.
                                     The ASSURE model involves a series of steps that include:

                                     Let us unpack what the above bullet points mean.
                                     General learner characteristics include the broad
                                     audience identification descriptors such as age,
                                     gender composition, grade level, learning ability,
                                     homogeneous or heterogeneous group, socio-cultural background,
                                     size of the audience, and any special learning needs.
                                     Specific entry competencies refer to knowledge and skills
                                     that learners either possess or lack such as pre-requisite
                                     skills, and attitudes. Learning styles refer to the spectrum of
                                     psychological traits that affect how we perceive and respond to
                                     different stimuli such as anxiety, aptitude, visual or auditory
                                     preferences, etc. Below, we are going to look closely at each analysis.

                                     Analysis of the learner characteristics is helpful in selecting
                                     instructional methods and media. For example, students with
                                     substandard reading skills may be reached more effectively
                                     with non-print media than with print. When teaching students
                                     in Swaziland, use of materials that represent familiar cultural
                                     identity will be more effective than when you use materials that
                                     are completely foreign to them. When you are teaching students that
                                     are entering a new conceptual area for the first time, direct and
                                     concrete experiences such as field trips will be more effective.
                                     Heterogeneous groups which include learners varying widely in their
                                     conceptual sophistication or in amount of first-hand experience on a
                                     certain topic will benefit more from an audio-visual experience
                                     such as a videotape.

                                     Students' prior knowledge of a particular subject influences
                                     how and what they learn. This means that before you plan a lesson,
                                     you need to verify the entry competencies of the learners, either
                                     through informal means such as in-class questioning, or formally
                                     through tests. Prerequisites refer to competencies that the learner
                                     must possess in order to benefit from the instruction, competencies
                                     that you or media are not going to teach. By analysing what the
                                     audience already knows helps you to select appropriate methods
                                     and media.

                                     Learning style refers to students' approaches to learning,
                                     problem-solving and processing information (Snow, Corno, & Jackson, 1996).
                                     Learning style can also be defined as a cluster of psychological traits that
                                     determine how an individual perceives, interacts with, and responds emotionally
                                     to learning environments (Heinich et al., 1996:37).

                                     Certain traits affect our ability to learn effectively from

                                     traits are most important.  Gardner (1993) who was dissatisfied
                                     with the concept of IQ and its unitary view of intelligence identified
                                     seven aspects of intelligence namely:
                                     <ol>

                                         <li>
                                             logical/mathematical (scientific)

                                         <li>
                                             interpersonal (ability to understand other people) and

                                         <li>
                                             intrapersonal (ability to understand oneself).

                                     Gardner's view implies that teachers, curriculum planners
                                     and media specialists should work together to design a
                                     curriculum in which students have a chance to develop
                                     these different aspects of intelligence. It also implies
                                     that students vary widely in terms of their strengths and
                                     weaknesses in each of these areas. The teacher should
                                     ensure that students are engaged in a wider variety of
                                     methods and media.

                                     One simple way of thinking about learning styles is to consider
                                     the sensory channels that a student prefers for taking in new information-
                                     visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.

                                     We need to note that students are not alike as they differ
                                     from each other in terms of their sensory preferences.
                                     Therefore, we should vary our instruction to accommodate
                                     those differences.

                                     in Unit 2, we noted that most of the information that we receive is obtained
                                     through our sense of sight. This view was confirmed by Dale's Cone of experience.

                                     Concrete sequential learners prefer direct, hands-on experiences presented
                                     in a logical order.   They are best with workbooks, demonstration, and
                                     structured laboratory exercises. Concrete random learners lean towards
                                     a trial-and-error approach and reaching conclusions from exploratory experiences.
                                     They prefer methods such as games, simulations, independent study projects and
                                     discovery learning. For abstract sequential learners decoding verbal and
                                     symbolic messages and readings as well as listening to presentations are
                                     preferred methods. Abstract random learners have the ability to draw meaning
                                     from human-mediated presentations as they respond to tone and style of the
                                     speaker as well as the message. They do well in group discussion and
                                     lectures with question-and-answer periods.

                                     Motivation refers to a process whereby a goal-oriented activity is instigated and
                                     maintained. Motivation is a common influence on human activities. Motivation makes
                                     direct contribution to learning by focusing students on certain desired learning
                                     goals and increasing the effort they expend in reaching those goals (Newby et al., 2006).
                                     Various emotional factors do influence what we pay attention to, how long we pay attention,
                                     how much effort we invest in learning, and how feelings may interfere with learning.
                                     Anxieties, locus of control, achievement motivation and competitiveness, are critical
                                     variables to the learning process.<br />
                                     Knowing something about your students' motivation will help with instructional
                                     planning as it will help you to add to the extrinsic or intrinsic appeal of
                                     instruction especially with regard to choice of instructional media.
                                     For example, you might use curiosity by presenting students with a variety of
                                     situations that are unique, surprising, or inconsistent with their existing ideas.

                                     These are factors related to gender differences,
                                     health, and environmental conditions. Boys and girls
                                     respond differently to school experiences. For example,
                                     boys tend to be more competitive and aggressive than girls
                                     and consequently respond better to competitive games.

                                     in making decisions about the types of instructional media to use.
                                     You are able to select media that are within the ability level of

                                     We need to remember that students are individuals and differ from one another in a variety of ways. We need to assess and address the special needs of all learners in our class.

                                     The second step in the ASSURE model is to state objectives of instruction.
                                     You need to decide on the learning outcomes that each learner will be expected
                                     to achieve. An objective is a statement of what each learner ought to get
                                     out of the lesson. The statement of objective should be as specific as possible.
                                     Statement of objectives influences the choice of instructional methods, media
                                     and materials as well as the sequence of learning activities. Statement of
                                     instructional objectives also helps to ensure proper lesson evaluation.

                                     this module will not discuss objectives in detail. The behaviours

                                     use a demonstration to present the new information.
                                     Finally you might arrange for drill-and-practice

                                     A media format is the physical form in which a message is incorporated
                                     and displayed. Media formats could include; audio, video,
                                     computer multimedia, still visuals (graphics, flip chart, etc.),
                                     text, etc.  In Unit 2 of this module we discussed the various
                                     types of media. Please refer to the relevant unit to remind
                                     yourself about the different types of media that we identified.
                                     Note that each media format has its unique strengths and limitations
                                     which make it suitable for use in different instructional situations.

                                     <em>Obtaining specific materials</em><br />
                                     Obtaining specific materials will generally involve one of three alternatives:
                                     <ol>
                                         <li>selecting available materials </li>
                                         <li>modifying existing materials </li>
                                         <li>designing new materials. </li>
                                     </ol>
                                 </p>
                                 <p class=" text-justify meme">
                                     When there are existing instructional materials that could allow the
                                     students to meet their instructional objectives, such materials
                                     should be used to save time and money.  However, when the existing
                                     materials do not completely meet your objectives or are not entirely
                                     suitable for your audience, an alternative approach is to modify the
                                     materials. For example, you might select a video whose content might
                                     not be suitable for your class but the visuals could be useful in
                                     illustrating certain concepts that you would like the students to understand.
                                     In such a case, you will remove the sound, and only select the relevant visuals to use.
                                 </p>

                                     When modification of existing materials is not possible, then your final
                                     alternative is to design and produce your own materials.
                                     This is an expensive and time consuming process but it
                                     allows you to prepare materials that serve your students
                                     well and meet your objectives.  Unit 4 discusses how to
                                     design and produce the various types of instructional
                                     materials. You might need to refer to this unit in case
                                     you decide to produce your own materials.

                                     The majority of instructional materials used by teachers are "off the shelf"
                                     as they are ready-made and available either in school or can be obtained
                                     from organizations, institutions, libraries, resource centres, video
                                     shops and publishers.   As a teacher, you need to be resourceful
                                     enough to survey possible sources of media. For example, you could
                                     request for media catalogues from the local publishers to identify
                                     what types of materials are available in the various subjects offered
                                     in your school.

                                     Before you select a particular type of media material, you need to ask
                                     yourself the following questions:

                                     the shelf, you might be able to modify what is available.
                                     Say for example you have a videotape that shows a needed
                                     visual sequence but the audio portion is inappropriate.
                                     In such a case you could show the video with the sound turned off
                                     and provide a narration yourself.  You can also use instructional
                                     games to teach certain concepts by merely changing the rules of
                                     play to increase or decrease the level of sophistication.

                                     You need to prepare the media and the materials to support the

                                     This is necessary whether you are presenting the

                                     First, gather the materials and equipment that you and your
                                     students will need. Then determine the sequence in which
                                     the media and materials will be used. Decide what you will do as
                                     you present the materials and what the students will do. It might
                                     be necessary to practice using the materials before actually using
                                     them in class. For a student-centred lesson, ensure that the students

                                     Wherever learning will take place, whether in a classroom,
                                     in the laboratory, in the field, etc., the facilities have
                                     to be arranged for proper students' use of media and materials.
                                     For example, the seating arrangement, the lighting, and ventilation,
                                     should be considered depending on the type of media being used.
                                     In case you are using a videotape, all the students should be able
                                     to view the presentation without being obstructed. Some of the media
                                     require a darkened room, convenient power source and access to light switches.
                                     <br /><br />
                                     Before using any equipment, check to confirm that it is working.
                                     In the case of the film or the overhead transparencies, ensure
                                     that the light bulb is not blown-off. In case you want the students
                                     to discuss the media after using it, arrange the seats so that
                                     students can see each other as they discuss the topic.

                                     What you could do to prepare the learners for the use of media may be to:

                                     Therefore, provide opportunities for the students to engage in some learning experiences.
                                     You should play the role of a guide to facilitate learning by helping students to explore
                                     the topic, discuss the content, etc. The students should be actively involved in
                                     the use of media and materials and not just be silent observers.
                                     Provide activities for the students to engage in as you use the media and
                                     materials in class.

                                     Active participation in the learning process enhances learning.
                                     Cognitive theories of learning, which focus on internal mental
                                     processes, have also supported the principle that effective
                                     learning demands active manipulation of information by learners.
                                     Gagne (1985),  concluded that there are several necessary conditions
                                     for effective learning of each type of objective, but one condition that
                                     pertains to all objectives is <i>'practice of the desired skill'</i>.
                                     Therefore, the most effective learning situations are those that
                                     require learners to perform activities that build toward the objective.
                                     The form of participation could include; practising new spelling of words,
                                     solving some mathematical problems, creating a product, observing some
                                     visuals and interpreting them, etc. Discussions, short quizzes,
                                     and application exercises can provide opportunities for practice and
                                     feedback during instruction. Follow-up activities can provide further
                                     opportunities for practice.

                                     The final component of the ASSURE model for effective learning is evaluation and
                                     revision. Evaluation as we know , is an on-going process and it can be done before,
                                     during and after instruction. For example, before instruction, you might want to
                                     find out whether learners have the necessary prerequisite knowledge to enter a new
                                     learning experience especially with regard to the use of the planned media and materials.
                                     You might also evaluate the media and materials before presenting it in class to confirm
                                     that it will meet the learners' intended learning outcomes. During instruction, evaluation
                                     is used in form of student practice of a desired skill, short quiz or self- evaluation.
                                     Evaluation at this stage is mainly diagnostic to help detect any teaching/learning problems
                                     and difficulties in the instructional process that might interfere with the attainment of
                                     objectives.

                                     <i>Evaluation of learner achievement</i><br />
                                     The ultimate question in the instructional process is whether the students have learned
                                     what they were supposed to learn (Heinich et al.; 1996:56).  Can they display the
                                     capabilities specified in the original statement of objectives?  At this stage,
                                     you want to assess whether the skills acquired by the learners meet this criterion.<br />
                                     Evaluation of achievement depends on the nature of objectives. For example,
                                     some objectives can be evaluated through written tests while others require
                                     practical activities.

                                     After using the media and materials, you need to reflect back and ask yourself

                                             foreign embassies accredited to the country, international organizations,
                                             National Curriculum Center, the Teacher Inservice Department, Government
                                             Ministries and departments, etc. Your local daily newspapers are also a
                                             potential source of instructional materials as they contain pictures,
                                             photographs, and textual materials (articles) that could be of interest
                                             in your subject.

                                             materials. You could use search engines to search for the materials and to access
                                             the various databases. Huge amounts of already prepared materials could be
                                             located and you are no longer limited to textbooks and resources in the
                                             library as the Internet makes available information resources from
                                             around the world.

                                             Before we end our discussion, let us remind ourselves of
                                             some of the things we have discussed.  In this unit we have
                                             noted that media to be used for instructional purposes should
                                             not be selected just because it is available or because the teacher
                                             prefers to use such media.  Instructional media should be selected
                                             based on a given criteria.  That criterion should include:
                                             <ul>
                                                 <li>The instructional goal and instructional objectives;</li>

                                             We went further and discussed the process for media

                                             the models that are used to inform us when selecting
                                             instructional media.

                                             We also discussed the concept of the systems approach.
                                             We defined the systems approach as an overall approach that
                                             involves tackling problems in a disciplined manner, yet
                                             keeping priorities in mind. The sub-systems making up
                                             the overall system are designed, fitted, checked and
                                             operated so as to achieve the overall objective efficiently.
                                             We noted that the systems approach is a problem-solving method
                                             that helps to:
                                             <ul>
                                                 <li>Define the problem as clearly as possible;</li>
                                                 <li>Analyze the problem and identify alternative solutions.</li>
                                                 <li>Select the alternatives and develop the most viable solution mix.</li>
                                                 <li>Implement and test the solution.</li>
                                                 <li>Evaluate the effectiveness and worth of the solution.  </li>

                                         <p class="text-justify meme">
                                             We went on to discuss the application of the systems approach to
                                             media selection and use.  Here we noted that we have to be systematic
                                             as we select media and materials. We have to be guided by some instructional
                                             goal/objectives and the focus should be the learner.  We concluded the unit
                                             by discussing the ASSURE model which is a procedural guide for planning
                                             instruction that incorporates the use of media. We noted that use of media
                                             has to be carried out in a systematic manner and the six procedural steps
                                             have to be followed. These steps include;
                                             <ul>
                                                 <li>Analyzing the learners</li>
                                                 <li>Stating objectives</li>
