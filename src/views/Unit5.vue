                                        In this unit, we discuss how to integrate instructional media into the
                                        instructional process. In particular, we focus on the integration of
                                        computer technology into the instructional process. As you may well be aware,
                                        the computer has invaded most instructional situations and therefore we need
                                        to embrace it to promote student learning.

                                        What you must not overlook is the fact that even if you use instructional media
                                        during instruction this does not suggest that they are used effectively. You need
                                        to know how to select media and integrate them into the lesson. Therefore, this unit
                                        is meant to assist you as teachers to know how to integrate computer technology as well
                                        as other media into teaching and learning.

                                        The fact that teachers bring instructional media into the
                                        classroom does not suggest that students learn from the media.
                                        For the media to be useful in the instructional process, it must
                                        be integrated into the lesson. The media must be properly selected,
                                        incorporated into the lesson, and students involved in the utilization
                                        process.  According to Duhaney (2000:71), technology use in the
                                        classroom should only be considered appropriate if it is used for
                                        specific purposes in the teaching and learning process, and
                                        that its incorporation in this process should not just be as
                                        an appendage, but an integral part of the teaching and learning objectives.

                                                in the educational system of many developing countries (Abu-Jaber, 1987; Abu-Ras,

                                                of technology that has been studied is the training required for effective use of

                                                in two areas; they must be able to operate technological hardware,
                                                and they must develop competencies in identifying and using appropriate

                                                new technology in the classroom, they are often unsuccessful because they
                                                lack the necessary implementation skills, including necessary training.

                                                which are already available in the business world, also available to students
                                                (Davis & Henry, 1993). Also, for this transition to smoothly occur, students must
                                                become actively involved, and teachers must be given the resources and training
                                                needed to properly implement technology (Moursund, 1991; Pearlman, 1999; Stintson, 1993).

                                        We are also aware of the fact that teachers are living in a time of general
                                        uncertainty where rapid changes in professional practice are commonplace
                                        (Wheeler, 2001:7). One of the most widepread changes in professional practice
                                        is emerging as a result of the implementation of Information and Communications
                                        technology (Wheeler, 2001:7).   In the context of teaching and learning, Jones & Knezek (1993),
                                        argue that ICT should be seen as a means of improving efficiency in the educational process.
                                        It has been shown that the use of computers in education can generally help to improve memory
                                        retention, increase motivation and generally deepen understanding (Dede, 1998).  According to
                                        Perraton (2000:31), Communication technologies have been used for three purposes, to
                                        <i>widen access to education, to raise its quality, and to reform it.</i>

                                        Heide & Henderson (2001) contends that technology can be used to enhance instruction
                                        and expand the limits of the existing curriculum as it can be used to
                                        obtain, organize, manipulate and communicate knowledge and information.
                                        Therefore, technology can be used to address the range of different
                                        learning styles and different modalities of individual learning strengths.
                                        We want students to learn how to acquire information where and when they
                                        want it and develop both their cognitive and communicative skills.
                                        According to Kershaw (1996), for delivery systems to be effective,
                                        they must act as a means of facilitating teaching and learning rather
                                        than an end in itself. This is illustrated by trends shifting from
                                        teacher-focused delivery systems to learner focused.

                                        a teacher must change (Wheeler, 2001:12).  Firstly, because
                                        certain teaching resources will become obsolete as new electronic

                                        in geography education (Nellis, 1994) with the most recent change being in the form of

                                        As we have indicated above, media should not be seen as an appendage but an integral
                                        part of your lesson. You need to conceive the media that you intend to use as part of
                                        your whole lesson. In that case, plan when to use media in your lesson and how it will
                                        be used and include it into your lesson plan. Since in a lesson plan you specify the teacher
                                        and learner activities; indicate what will be the role of the teacher as well as the role of
                                        the students when the media is used.  Also specify when a particular media will be used.
                                        This helps you as a teacher to prepare the media and to plan both the teacher and learner
                                        activities prior to using the media.

                                        This suggests that as you state the lesson objectives, you need to specify the intended
                                        application of instructional media to the different types of learning outcomes; i.e. cognitive,
                                        affective, or psychomotor depending on the role that you want the media to play in your lesson
                                        and the outcomes that you wish the students to achieve by using the selected media.
                                        Different types of media help us to achieve the cognitive, affective and psychomotor
                                        learning domains to varying degrees. So, be sure what type of learning outcome you would
                                        like the selected media to achieve in your lesson.

                                        into the teaching/learning experience. The computer which is a commonly used media
                                        technology, is used here as an example. The first thing to consider in this process
                                        is to consider your instructional objectives. Then ask yourself the question; <i>

                                        In answering the above question, you need to note the role of a computer in a classroom setting.
                                        The computer can play different roles during instruction. The computer can be a <i>
                                            teacher,
                                            an assistant and also a learner
                                        </i>. In this case then it will be easier
                                        to integrate it into your lesson.

                                        The oldest use of the computer in education dating back
                                        to early 1960s was as a tool that presents instruction directly
                                        to students (Newby at el., 2006).  Such is termed as <i>computer assisted instruction</i> (CAI),
                                        <i>computer-based instruction </i>CBI), or <i>computer-assisted learning</i> (CAL).
                                        In this mode, the computer can present instruction, use various media
                                        (text, graphics, audio, video, etc.), provide instructional activities or
                                        situations, or otherwise require interaction from learners, evaluate learners' responses,
                                        provide feedback, and determine appropriate follow-up activities.
                                        You should then use it in the appropriate events in the instruction.

                                        The chief advantage of the computer is its interactivity. The computer
                                        can demand active learner involvement, and when you use it as a teaching machine,

                                        or knowledge through repetitive work. The purpose is to give learners the opportunity
                                        to master the material at their own pace. Compared with non-computer drill and practice,
                                        the computer offers significant advantages:

                                        The computer becomes the learner and the student becomes the teacher. The objective

                                        This requires the student to apply programming language.

                                        Electronic mail (e-mail) is the most widely used
                                        service on the Internet. Anyone with a computer
                                        connected to the Internet can communicate with
                                        anyone else in the world that is connected. You
                                        can use the Internet to join discussion groups where
                                        you can ask questions, discuss problems and share experiences.

                                        When planning any instructional activity involving the Internet,
                                        develop a plan by doing the following:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <i>Consider the learner characteristics.</i>
                                                When using the Internet, consider the students'
                                                abilities to access the Internet for communication,
                                                information retrieval, and information publishing.
                                                If students do not have such skills, you will need to teach them.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <i>Specify the instructional objectives</i>. You should only use the
                                                Internet if it will add value to your lesson.
                                                So consider why you want to use the Internet during the lesson.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>

                                                students should have access to computers with Internet
                                                connection. The type of connection in your classroom or computer
                                                laboratory might limit your options. For example, dial-up
                                                connection on the Internet tends to be slower than the broad band connection

                                                <i>Preparation is key to success</i>. Prepare the learning environment,
                                                prepare the learners, and then proceed with the lesson.
                                                While preparing the learning environment, check to confirm
                                                that the computers are working properly and have Internet access.
                                                Schedule the computer laboratory if you plan to have several students
                                                access the Internet at the same time. Confirm that the web sites that
                                                you want to use are available. Prepare the students for the lesson
                                                activity whether to be done individually, in small groups, or as a class.
                                                Provide written guidelines on the activities to be undertaken by the students.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                When the lesson begins, monitor individual students to keep them on task and
                                                to be sure they are following the Internet use guidelines.

                                        After the lesson, you and your students need to
                                        take time to evaluate how the use of the
                                        Internet worked. You need to determine whether
                                        your students learned from the experience.

                                                 In this unit, we have discussed how to integrate instructional
                                                 media during instruction. One of the things we have noted in
                                                 this unit is that generally some teachers do not integrate
                                                 media into their lessons. The main reason because of limited
                                                 or no training on media integration. We also discussed at
                                                 length how you can integrate the computer into teaching and
                                                 learning. Remember that in order to effectively integrate the
                                                 computer, we need to be very clear of the intended role of the
                                                 computer during instruction.   We have noted that the first thing
                                                 to consider in that process is to consider your instructional objectives.
                                                 Then ask yourself the question; "What is it that I want  my students to
                                                 learn and how can the computer be of benefit?"
